Many people know that I'm currently on a 12 months Canada experience. I gave up my apartment in my home country (Germany) and moved to Canada with a temporary work permit.   

To cover my experiences I created a blog which is hosted under my domain at https://canada.aaronczichon.de.   
This repository is the source code for this blog.   

## Technical stack

The website is using [Astro](https://astro.build) as a base library. For some interactive components (Astro Islands) I'm using preact.   
The design is custom CSS whithout any additional CSS library.   
The images are mostly hosted on my personal [Directus](https://directus.io) instance. This has the benefit that the server generates me thumbnails and smaller version on the fly.

## Is it free to use?

Yeah of course! Use it for your own website, blog or whatever. It's open source and free to use. I would appreciate it if you name me in your imprint or something if you use it as a base ðŸ˜Š   

## Contribution

In the unlikely event that you want to contribute, feel free to create a Pull Request.
