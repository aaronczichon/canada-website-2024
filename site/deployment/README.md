# Deployment Files

This folder contains files which are required for deployment and/or the hosting provider.  
Currently I'm using Cloudflare Pages as my deployment target.  
The `_headers` file is used to add headers for specific websites.

## \_headers

I don't want search engines to index \*canada-website-2024.pages.dev pages as only the production version (canada.aaronczichon.de) should be indexed.
