It's now been a week since we arrived in Halifax. After the usual arrival issues such as moving into our apartment, overcoming jet lag and 1-2 basic grocery shopping trips, we have now arrived safely.

> Arrival in Halifax with rain and -10 degrees.

The weather is a little crazy on the coast and is like a "classic" April from the old days. Sometimes there's bright sunshine, lots of wind and clouds or lots of rain. Or all the above. The temperatures are also currently fluctuating wildly between -10 degrees when we arrived and +11 degrees in some places.

Our apartment is in the south-eastern part of Halifax on South Street. This is not directly downtown but everything is within walking distance. It is about 600m to the harbor, about 1.5km to downtown and Citadel and 2km to Point Pleasant Park. Everything you need to live (primarily groceries) can also be reached on foot in about 5 minutes. As we don't currently have a car, this makes things a lot easier for us.

So far, we still want to discover something new every day (or rediscover something familiar from last year). So, the first weekend and the afternoons after work were used intensively. From walks around the harbor and Point Pleasant Park to ferry trips to Dartmouth and an open mic visit to The Loose Cannon, everything was included. Today we are going to a classic Halifax Mooseheads ice hockey game.

As we continue to work "normally" straight away, it is of course important to switch to an appropriate mode here too. We are still trying to find the right working environment and are also happy to change our place of work (between a small desk, dining table in our apartment or the Halifax Library).

All in all, it's still a bit surreal to be here in Canada for the next 12 months!
