If you always thought Germany was the land of the car, you're probably way off the mark. Here in Canada, there is only one real means of public transportation and that is the plane. For everything else, there are cars.  
Of course, things are a little different in the cities. Here in Halifax, for example, there is already a Halifax Transit network. This includes buses and ferries. The ones that are available also run very regularly. But only in the greater city area.  
If you want to see something about 20-30km outside the city, you can't avoid a car.

Now you might think: Okay, maybe that's not the most ecological way, but if that's the case, then you'll have plenty of opportunities to get a car.  
Over the last few days, we've been doing some thinking about cars. The fact is that we definitely want to stay in Newfoundland from the end of April to the end of July. In other words, we will drive from Halifax to Cape Breton, take the ferry from there to Newfoundland and then from the ferry terminal to our next accommodation in Brighton.

> 1033km from Halifax, NS to Brighton, NL. Pure driving time of approx. 15h. Of this time approx. 8 hours are on the ferry.

The initial plan was: We could by a used car in Halifax, use it until summer, possibly until the end of August, and then sell it again.  
Until you take a closer look at the topic.

As in Germany, you need car insurance here. This is required before you buy and register the car. The first problem we have now realized is that there are different legal requirements for insurance depending on the province. There are provinces such as British Colombia and Alberta where there is a state car insurance and that's it. No competition, no long search. Website, book, done. Now it's different in Nova Scotia. There is a "free" market here, like Germany.  
After writing to a few insurance brokers to ask for a quote, it quickly became clear that many of the insurance companies only accept national driving licenses and that they must run for at least 12 months (and be paid for).  
So, we came up with the idea of exchanging the German driver's license for a Nova Scotian one (as this is mandatory for stays longer than 90 days anyway). The second problem that arose was that we wanted to change states or provinces. In other words, most insurance policies can only be taken out for the respective province. The same applies to the vehicle.
In our case, we would have to have the car transferred to Newfoundland at the Motor Vehicle Registration. Together with the driver's license (Nova Scotia driver's license -> Newfoundland and Labrador driver's license) and cancel the insurance (which includes penalties for extraordinary cancellation under 6 months) and take out a new one.

All in all, the costs would be very high. The transfer/exchange of the driver's license costs every time, the car of course initially, the taxes of the car purchase (which are levied when the vehicle is registered/registered) and the insurance.  
With the insurances we are not talking about German prices of a liability insurance of about 300-700€ (depending on the vehicle) but about 200-400C$ (about 130-270€) per month.

Now we have decided to go the way of a rental car. Insurance is included and rental cars can be used freely across provincial borders and even in the USA. Of course, the money we pay here is "gone", but the rental car now costs us about twice as much for 3 months as the insurance would have cost us for our own vehicle.

The current plan after that is to drive back to Halifax in mid-July, return the vehicle there and take the train from Halifax to Montréal.

Trains are even less available in Canada than buses. However, there is a coast-to-coast connection that runs from Halifax to Vancouver, and you can get on and off at almost all major cities in the south of Canada.  
We want to use this option as an alternative to the plane at least as far as Montréal and hope to see a lot of the landscape in New Brunswick and Québec.

For the trips to the upper part of the country, which we definitely want to do, we will have to rely on the plane for better or worse. Unfortunately, Yellowknife and Whitehorse cannot be reached any other way.

the other hand, is great here. Along the harbor promenade, for example.
