Last weekend on Saturday we took advantage of the good weather to visit Governors Brook District Park.

We are currently trying to visit many places in and around Halifax and Dartmouth by public transport (mainly by bus).  
This park is also quite easy to reach by bus from our apartment, with a journey time of around 35 minutes.  
The great thing is that all Halifax Transit means of transportation cost only 2.75C$ for 2.5 hours (no matter how long the route is and how often you use a means of transportation).

The park itself consists of 90% rocks and a former forest that was probably destroyed by a forest fire a few years ago.  
Slowly, however, a new life is emerging there and many of the trail routes within the park are used by mountain bikers.
