On Saturday we went to the Canadian Immigration Museum Pier 21 down at the harbor, which really impressed us. We would love to share some of our experiences with you.

Between 1912 and 1967, Pier 21 was operated to provide a new home for over 800,000 immigrants in Canada.

The first peak in immigration numbers was before the First World War, the second after the Second World War. The guide in the museum is our age and she told us that her grandmother immigrated to Canada from Great Britain via Pier 21. An older woman - a visitor - told us that her grandparents had fled from Germany to Canada to escape the Nazi regime. It is impressive to see that much of the history of immigration in Canada was not so long ago and ultimately still affects today's generation.

saw this store first when they arrived in Halifax. Here they could buy food for
their onward journey.

personal connection to Pier 21? You can write it down here for everyone in the
world.

Initially, many people from Europe immigrated by ship, then mostly by train further inland. Halifax was the shortest route for Europeans. Most came from Germany, France, Germany, Poland, the former Soviet Union, Italy, Great Britain and Ireland. In the 2010s, many arrived in Canada from Asia, Africa and South America.

Many testimonials were shown in the form of text and film from emigrants about their first experiences on Canadian soil and with the Canadian people and their mentality. Then, as now, people were surprised by the white bread (toast here) and spaghetti in a can.

Even when we landed in Halifax, we were a bit nervous as to whether we would get the visa straight away and whether we would be able to understand and answer all the border official's questions correctly. And we made the experience that the official was very nice and friendly. He kept apologizing because the process was a bit slower (as he hadn't issued a visa like this for a long time). He then immediately put two false stamps in Aaron's passport and one false stamp in Lea's passport. We liked that.

This friendliness and calmness of the Canadians were emphasized again and again in the museum in the testimonials. But of course, the museum also shared stories of migrants who were unable to develop a sense of belonging and had therefore returned to their country of origin.

Multiculturalism has been an official government policy in Canada since 1971. This affirms the diversity and dignity of all Canadian citizens, regardless of their origin, language or religious affiliation. This is evident in even the smallest of everyday occurrences: advertising banners depict people from a wide variety of cultures and nations, churches display signs that reaffirm this, and in general, cosmopolitanism is not only affirmed but actively practiced everywhere.
