For the Easter weekend, we decided to spend our free days in the southern part of Nova Scotia.  
We were not yet familiar with this part of the (semi-)island and there is a lot to see there (although this is not described in the usual "travel destinations" and sights of Nova Scotia).

had booked directly on the lake.

After picking up the rental car last Wednesday (27.03.) and visiting Cow Bay and Lawrencetown nearby in the late afternoon, we set forward the south after work on Thursday.  
The weather was, as usual for Easter here, bad. It rained both on Thursday (which didn't really matter for the outward journey) and all day on Friday.  
Or as it was appropriately described on the radio: Did you ever remember a Good Friday in the last 30 years when it wasn't raining in Nova Scotia?  
I think that says it all.

However, we didn't let the weather spoil our Friday and first we went to Cape Forchu and Bear Island. There we took a short walk around the local lighthouse. The main point of interest on this day was Yarmouth, the only "town" in the south of Nova Scotia (population around 7,000).

From Yarmouth, we drove to the beach at Comeaus Hill and then had dinner near our accommodation in Meteghan in the evening.

## Canada üá®üá¶ Facts ‚úîÔ∏è

**Today: Acadian French üá´üá∑**  
French is also spoken a lot here in the south (as we already know from the northern part, Cape Breton, from last year).  
Together with Newfoundland, parts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island as well as parts of Maine (USA), Nova Scotia belongs to the so-called Acadian territory.  
Acadians or French Acadians are an ethnic group who are considered to be the successors of the former French settlers from the 17th and 18th centuries.  
About 0.78% of the total population in Canada are Acadians. The largest populations are in New Brunswick (14.3%), Prince Edward Island (5.6%) and Nova Scotia (5.1%).  
The exciting thing is that the people speak what is known as Acadian French. This is a separate offshoot of the French language which is very strongly mixed with English here.
Acadian French itself has another 7 different regional accents.  
While it is only recognized as a minority language in Nova Scotia, PEI and Qeubec, it is recognized as an official language in New Brunswick.

nice caf√©s like this in the smaller towns. This one was in Yarmouth.
