If you missed [part 1](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/blog/05-good-friday/), you should definitely read it as well. There's something to learn about Acadian French!

We continued in the other direction at the weekend, on Saturday to be precise. After moving in and around Yarmouth on Friday, our plan was to drive through Yarmouth to the southern tip.

Our first stop was therefore the Pubnico Harbour Lighthouse and its beach. Lea had set herself the goal of seeing as many lighthouses as possible in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
However, all of them will be impossible. There are 160 historic lighthouses in Nova Scotia alone.

On the road along the coast through Pubnico, Middle East Pubnico, Centre East Pubnico and Lower East Pubnico, we continued to Upper Woods Harbour. After we drove on, there was also Central Woods Harbour, Lower Woods Harbour and so on.

## Canada üá®üá¶ Facts ‚úîÔ∏è

**Today: Location names in southern Nova Scotia.**  
The place names actually describe districts in southern Nova Scotia. The province is sparsely populated in the south and therefore many houses and smaller clusters of houses are grouped together to form places that are sometimes miles apart.  
Let's take the first example. The entire village is actually called Pubnico. However, as the houses are spread over several kilometers, a "larger" number of groups of houses (3+) have been combined into one part, e.g. Middle East Pubnico. The part then usually indicates the direction from the town center.  
You can imagine it a bit like a city that is divided into districts, and these have names. Only in the other direction, it is not because of the size but the distance that it gets its own name.

Now that we've seen a few sandy beaches here, you could almost consider planning your next summer vacation in Nova Scotia. We've only seen it in spring so far...
The beaches often have libraries with beach toys for children.

We even made it to "The Hawk" on Saturday. This is almost the southernmost point of Nova Scotia.

As we always want to avoid driving a longer distance twice, we started the way back through the interior of the country.  
As we already know that Canada doesn't have the best roads, but the highways are okay, we had already had our experiences with potholes and the like.  
However, the roads off the highways where even fewer people live are a completely different matter...

Of course, the good weather had to be rounded off at the end of the day with the first barbecue of the year.

On Sunday, we drove in the other direction. If you take our cabin as the starting point again, this time we headed north.

We also visited various sandy beaches, such as here in Belliveaus Cove or in Sandy Cove on the Gulf of Maine. If you squint really hard, you can almost see the USA on the other side of the Gulf. But only almost.

We didn't end Sunday with a barbecue (we went back to the restaurant from Friday) but instead watched the sun set over the horizon of the sea in our town, Salmon River. That was another highlight.

Tomorrow is the 3rd and final part of the Easter weekend. Look forward to the Kejimkujik National Park and what blocked our hikes there!

P.S. Of course we also visit the places along our route. Shelburne, for example.
