Now we have the last day, Easter Monday, to offer you. As already announced, there is a video here. But let's start at the beginning.  
Before heading back home to Halifax in the evening, we had planned to visit the large national park, Kejimkujik. In the hope of visiting a park in Nova Scotia that is not "closed for season". The weather certainly looked promising.

As we come from the south of Nova Scotia, we were able to drive the first part of the route along the coast before heading inland for the second part. This part was more tedious. Also because the roads off the highway are not very good.  
The country is also actually very well equipped with mobile phone and internet coverage. Everywhere there is even one house, there is mobile phone and internet. However, if you drive on roads where there are not even houses, there is no reception. So not even mobile phone coverage.  
As we were already familiar with this from other visits to Canada, we downloaded offline maps.

The park itself was very empty. In Canada, you normally have to buy a park pass to get in during the season. But as we were once again visiting a park outside the main season, the ticket booth was not occupied.  
We were also usually the only car in the parking lots near the hiking trails.

The first trail led us along Lake Kejimkujik to a small park which is certainly very popular in summer. We wanted to start the second part of the trail through the park, but we didn't get any further relatively quickly as the path was flooded with water.  
The lakes in Nova Scotia are currently struggling with high water - all the rivers and lakes are carrying more water than usual and are bursting their banks, flooding cabins, paths and so on.

<DirectusImage assetId="0ad3319e-8d3d-44e3-b22e-bc41d94f65fd" />

So we turned around and drove a little further into the park to the next hiking trail.

can drive once around a traffic island here to turn around.

We initially took the wrong path. According to the map, we actually wanted to walk along the Mersey River, but we started off on the wrong trail at the parking lot.  
That didn't matter in principle, as we found out that you can walk a circular route via the Sentier Flowing Waters Trail and then back along the river. That sounded good, as we didn't want to walk back the same way anyway.  
Almost at our destination, however, we ran into another problem. But see for yourself....

From this flooded area, it was actually only about 400-600m back to the parking lot. But as we couldn't cross the water and there was water everywhere in the forest, we had to walk all the way back again.

destination: the small loop of the Ukme'k Trail

However, we arrived back in Halifax unscathed after the day and were correspondingly exhausted in the evening.  
When we returned the car on Tuesday, we realized that we had already driven another 1589 km in 6 days. The distances here are not to be underestimated. And that in "small" Nova Scotia.

## Canada üá®üá¶ Facts ‚úîÔ∏è

**Today: Kejimkujik**

The national park inherited its name from the lake of the same name, Kejimkujik, which is located in the middle of the park.  
The original name is actually Kejimkuji'jk and comes from the First Nations Mi'kmaw who have inhabited the land for centuries. It roughly means "Fairy Lake".  
The largest bay of the lake is still called Fairy Bay today.

Every national park in Canada is listed and maintained on the parks.canada.ca website. You can also find [Kejimkujik](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ns/kejimkujik) there.  
The website is cool for the reason that you can find current information (e.g. when it's closed due to snow), info points, hiking trails, stories and background information. Definitely one of my favorite websites.  
The great thing is that all parks in Canada can be found there. Where there are so many different regulations and laws in the states and provinces, there is a central point of contact. Germany could learn something from that.
