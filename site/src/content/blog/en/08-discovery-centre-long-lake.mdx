Our time in Halifax is slowly coming to an end. We only have 2 weeks left here. Somehow that's a shame, as we really like Halifax.  
The people here are super nice (even nicer than in the rest of Canada), the city is the perfect size with around 200,000 inhabitants and you can quickly get out into nature. The surrounding lakes make weekend activities easy, and the sea is within walking distance.  
Maybe we'll be back sooner than we thought.

## Discovery Centre

Last weekend, we used the rainy Saturday to cross a few more items off our bucket list. The Discovery Center was still on the list.

Not only children, but also adults can discover environmental, energy and aviation topics on various levels. There is also currently a special exhibition on ice hockey and its history.  
You can spend a good 2.5 to 3 hours here. There are also large indoor play areas, craft corners and Lego stations for children.

## Long Lake & Witherod Lake

The weather was much better on Sunday, we even had sunshine and could go hiking without a jacket!  
We took the bus back out of town (you can get quite far by bus!). There we hiked along Long Lake and Witherod Lake.  
There was everything from paved footpaths to undergrowth trails. The views were great, as always.  
You could almost say that every lake in Canada simply has a great atmosphere.
