On Wednesday we went to the Halifax Library for National Canadian Film Day. This year the movie Ru was shown.

Ru is a Canadian film drama directed by Charles-Olivier Michaud from 2023. The movie is about a family of five who moved to Quebec as refugees from the Vietnam War. It focuses on the family's challenges in adapting to their "new" life and culture near Montreal.  
Daughter Tinh, in particular, initially has difficulties coping with the separation from her best friend and cousin. She also shows symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder due to her experiences in her country of origin and during the escape (by boat).  
The family receives support from a very nice neighboring family. She shows them the traditions and food culture in Canada (according to the father of the family, there must be a toaster in every household) and helps the parents to find a job.

I found the movie very moving because it portrays the challenges of a refugee family and immigration to a foreign country in a very authentic way.

On Thursday we went to a very nice café to eat our first pancakes.  
I ordered pancakes with caramelized bananas and Aaron ordered blueberry pancakes. I thought long and hard about whether to have a 'small' portion. Due to my hunger, I ended up ordering the 'normal' portion. I only just managed one pancake and didn't need any more food for the next few hours. But they were super tasty.

As the weather was very nice and sunny again on Sunday (and the temperatures were slowly rising), we decided to explore the area outside Halifax again. We took the bus to Bedford and wanted to walk the trails in Bedford Lions Sandy Lake Park. We went right through the forest. Some of the trail was unrecognizable. As in the south of Nova Scotia, the abundance of water once again put a spanner in the works. Of course, we immediately looked for alternative routes, but you can see what happened in the following video:
