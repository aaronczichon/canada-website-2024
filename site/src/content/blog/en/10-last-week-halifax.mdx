Our time in Halifax has now come to an end, for the time being.  
The last few days the temperature has finally risen significantly (between 12-15 degrees) and the sun is shining brightly. Evil tongues would say that Halifax is happy to see us go.

Wolfi and Laura have been visiting since last Tuesday. Both will be joining us on our journey to Newfoundland and we are all very excited to see what awaits us there.

We used the last few days of nice weather to do a few things we had on our list. Especially in terms of shopping, as we won't have any major shopping opportunities in Brighton, Newfoundland.  
On Thursday we drove to Peggy's Cove in the afternoon to see the most famous lighthouse in Canada once again. Here too, the weather played along (except for strong winds).
A detour to Lunenburg, which is a World Heritage Site, was also possible.  
We were then able to attend the Newcomer Caf√© in the Halifax Library right on time at 6:30pm.

The Newcomer Caf√© was something we enjoyed so much that we were a little disappointed that we hadn't discovered it at the beginning of our stay.  
This is a program that takes place every 2 weeks at the library and welcomes all "newcomers" to Halifax. When we took part, we played a guessing game in groups in which we had to answer questions about Canadian culture, history, celebrities and linguistic peculiarities.  
We had a lot of fun because we got to spend more time with other people and met people from all over the world.  
Unfortunately, we won't be back in Halifax in two weeks to cook poutine together üò©

Sunday was a hard day cleaning our apartment and packing our suitcases again. As we are now completely changing our place of residence again, we must pack everything accordingly.
Of course, we also have food that we need (and want) to take with us and therefore have more luggage than when we arrived.

Finally, on Monday morning, before we set off for Cape Breton, we go to Elle's Bistro for breakfast with Wolfi and Laura (also because it's Wolfi's birthday). Strengthened, we head north.
