But let's start from the beginning.  
Last Monday I picked up our rental car for the next 3 months at the airport in Halifax and drove back to the apartment.  
Somehow, in 2 months, we accumulate a lot of things that we must take with us in addition to our luggage. This includes all the spices, things from the fridge, onions, cleaning products and so on. It's a good thing that Wolfi and Laura rented their own vehicle. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to fit in all the luggage for 4 people.

After packing, we went to Elle's Bistro for brunch to start the day of travel and Wolfi's birthday.  
Strengthened, we set off in the direction of Cape Breton, the northern peninsula of Nova Scotia which we had already visited last year.  
With 2 stopovers in New Glasgow and Inverness, we reached our apartment directly on the Cabot Trail.  
There we celebrated Wolfi's birthday with a hot tub and drinks.

The next day started accordingly early. Everything was quickly packed up again and we set off for Ingonish. There we looked for another hiking route. This route of just 8 km led up a mountain from where you had a wonderful view in all directions. Fortunately, the weather played along, and we were able to enjoy this beautiful view.

The second part of the route that day then led to North Sydney. From there, our ferry left for Newfoundland.  
We had already booked a cabin a few weeks ago and were therefore able to spend the crossing from 11:15pm to 7:30am sleeping.

When we arrived at Port aux Basques, we still had about 4.5 hours of pure driving time ahead of us to Brighton.  
At some point on the way, we realized that our time zone had shifted by half an hour. That totally confused us.

We made a stopover in Corner Brook to take a short walk around the town, have breakfast and walk a short trail.

We arrived in Brighton late in the evening at 7:30pm. And it's even better than we thought!  
In the middle of nowhere, a small village with few inhabitants and nice people. We are excited to see what the next few weeks will bring us here!

Today: Newfoundland Timezone
Newfound is the only [American time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_Time_Zone) with a 30min shift to UTC time.  
Since the rest of the East Coast is in the ADT/AST (Atlantic Timezone), we were quite confused to suddenly find ourselves in a different timezone in Newfoundland.  
As a result, our time zone is no longer -5h behind CEST but "only" -4.5h.
