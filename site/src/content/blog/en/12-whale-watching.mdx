We've barely been in Brighton a week and we've already experienced a lot. The locals would probably say that we're getting bored now that we're so far at the end of the world. But I don't believe that.

Last Saturday we took the opportunity to travel to the neighboring island of Long Island. We drove through Triton and Pilly's Island and took the ferry to Long Island.  
The weather was windy and cold but that didn't stop us from choosing a trail (Beothuk Hiking Trail) and walking it.  
What can I say. It was worth it. Even on our first short excursion, we were able to discover and marvel at an iceberg.

The rest of the trail through the forest and up a mountain also offered breathtaking views that you normally only see in documentaries or pictures.

Fredi and Christian arrived in the evening and the six of us had supper together.  
Without further ado, we wrote to a resident of Triton on Saturday evening to ask if we could go on a whale watching tour on Sunday at short notice.

After we got the message at 6am that he had a slot for us at 10am, we got ready and drove to Triton.  
After a pleasant chat, we set off.  
First, we went out to sea and to a stretch of coast which offered us the sight of a bald eagle's nest. We also visited a bay with a small cave.

The highlights, however, were of course the 2 (!) whales and seeing an iceberg up close.

Today: Icebergs  
Iceberg drifting is famous in Newfoundland. Icebergs drift from Greenland along the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland towards the south.  
An iceberg is on the move for an average of 2 years.  
The number of icebergs has increased significantly in recent years. The iceberg season has also started much earlier for the second year in a row. The icebergs are normally seen between the middle/end of May and the end of June/beginning of July.  
These are all consequences of climate change.
