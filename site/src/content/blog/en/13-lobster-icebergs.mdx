On Wednesday evening, we were invited to a lobster dinner by the landlords of our two friends Fredi and Christian. They also invited two other guests.  
They brought the lobsters in a box. The landlord (Jason) has his own food company and stores the lobsters there in small water cages.

The lobsters are dark (a combination of red, brown and black). The rubber bands on the lobsters' claws were removed one by one. They were then thrown into a boiling water bath and cooked for 15 minutes. The lobsters where then bright red. Jason broke open the lobsters and explained how to get to the meat.  
It was very impressive and really great that we were able to eat lobster together with our friends. The landlady had made burgers with potato wedges for Aaron.  
It was a lovely exchange with Jason, his wife Larisa (who is originally from Latvia), John and Roxana (who last lived in Germany for three years), Fredi and Christian. They gave us a lot of information about icebergs, fishing, the landscape, culture and politics in Canada.

The next day we set off to "hunt" icebergs. Our first destination was on the Baie Verte the small fishing village of Seal Cove. There we discovered two larger icebergs and two smaller icebergs. The shapes of the icebergs are really impressive. We met a couple there who were also currently "hunting" icebergs. They recommended that we see another large iceberg in the north-east of the bay, in Round Harbour. We drove there and it was gigantic. We came over the hilltop and looked down on the fishing village and the gigantic iceberg from above.
We tried to get as close as possible to the iceberg and were able to hold pieces of the iceberg in our hands ("bergy bits" = fragments of the iceberg). The ice was very heavy, very compacted and very cold.  
If you take a closer look at the iceberg, you can also see blue cracks. An iceberg only shimmers deep blue if it contains very few air bubbles. This fact has to do with the properties of ice with very little air.  
Icebergs can take up to two years to reach Newfoundland. In the process, they can change their shape (parts break off). It is also incredible imagination that 10% of the iceberg is just out of the water and 90% is submerged. The icebergs dock at the bottom of the bay, slowly melt and then continue their journey.
