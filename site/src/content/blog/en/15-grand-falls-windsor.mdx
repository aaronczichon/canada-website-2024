Last weekend, on Saturday, we drove to Grand Falls Windsor. It was the last day for joint activities with Fredi and Christian. Unfortunately, they left on Sunday.

Grand Falls Windsor is about 1.5 hours away from Brighton.   
As the weather was great that day, we made a stop near Badger on the way.   
There, after a short trail, we visited Thunder Brook Falls.

When we arrived in Grand Falls Windsor, we wanted to do a bit of shopping. Unfortunately, the yield wasn't that good and nothing suitable was found.   
Luckily, we discovered a trail around Corduroy Pond. As the weather was still great, we took advantage of it to visit the trail.

There were plenty of squirrels on the trail

On the way back, we stopped at a Sobeys and did some bulk shopping, as there are no large grocery stores in Brighton and Triton.

In the evening, we fired up the sauna, went ice bathing and rounded off the day in comfort.
