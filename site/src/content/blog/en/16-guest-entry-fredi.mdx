After a week in New York, Christian and I landed in a very foggy St. Johns at 2 a.m., three hours late. The 6-hour drive the next day took us through endless forests and waters, with no sign of urban life. The vastness and emptiness of the landscape made me feel momentarily lost after the hustle and bustle of the big city. But when we got out of the car, saw the sea at our feet, felt the warmth of our hosts and were embraced by our friends, I felt I had arrived. In a place where we would have loved to stay longer.

During our exploration tour of Triton and the surrounding area, we immersed ourselves in a world full of untouched nature and the anticipation of discoveries with our friends. As a tourist, you usually know what you are looking for and, above all, where to find it. It's different with nature, you hope to see icebergs, whales and moose. But there is no guarantee of seeing them. Funnily enough, despite the many moose on the island, we didn't see a single one. With an estimated 150,000 moose on an area a third of the size of Germany, we should have expected to see one. Instead, we just stumbled over moose droppings - my dad joked that they must have sensed that Chris was a hunter. The good thing was that our rental car was safe from a moose test.

While the moose successfully hid from us, we were luckier in our hunt for icebergs. We were always able to keep an eye on the first iceberg, which we admired from the boat, from our AirBnB. For the others, we sometimes drove 2-3 hours - only to have one right in front of us two days before we left Lea and Aaron's accommodation. The morning Lea spotted it when she looked out of the window, it triggered a euphoria that you only understand when you yourself are gripped by iceberg fever. Suddenly and silently, it was there, stranded in a bay. It's a long journey, so you can take a break. The icebergs, which break off from glaciers in Greenland and drift down "Iceberg Alley", take up to two years to surface off the coast of Newfoundland. It is fascinating to observe how these millennia-old ice masses turn back into water within a few days. They only become really "beautiful" when they take on interesting shapes as they melt. The icebergs can be up to 700 meters deep and only 10 percent of an iceberg is visible above water. It made me think of the tragic story of the Titanic, which sank not far from Newfoundland. Our landlady told us that an iceberg the size of London ran aground off Newfoundland last year. I could also hardly imagine the story that polar bears have already used the icebergs as a means of transportation and thus ended up on Newfoundland.

When the so-called "Bergy Bits" float in the water, you have the opportunity to hold a piece of them in your hands or even taste them - who has ever tasted ice that old? Due to their density, these ice bits have a longer shelf life than ordinary ice cubes and are therefore not only popular in drinks. Even fishermen are now chasing icebergs, as the pristine water sells for the equivalent of 11 euros a bottle.

The yellow color of the tap water, which is apparently caused by iron, is very unusual. One reads that Newfoundland probably covers over 50 % of Canada's iron requirements. Water after filtering:

We had difficulty understanding some of the locals; I've read that there are more different accents spoken in Newfoundland than in England.

We had to smile at the fact that every meter is covered by car. Even when people were tending the graves, we saw cars parked right next to the graves in the cemetery - in the village on Newfoundland there is no place for peace and quiet - it was quiet enough when you were alive. I was particularly surprised by a small cemetery right in front of a house - a strange front garden. Plastic flowers attached to the gravestones everywhere:

Our encounters with the locals also showed us that the work culture in Newfoundland ticks differently to ours. While some may criticize the relaxed attitude to work, Chris and I couldn't believe that our German work ethic would make us exemplary employees there. We also received job offers - I wonder if we would adapt our work ethic while living there?

The Newfoundland couple we met at the accommodation had lived in Oberammergau for three years and had now bought a house in Triton for their (early) retirement. While their furniture was still in the container, they temporarily lived in the accommodation. It was interesting to hear their perspective on Germany.

What makes exploring a foreign country even more exciting? Spending time with friends, sharing experiences and eating and playing cards together! We really enjoyed our time with Lea and Aaron as well as Laura and Wolfgang, who were visiting at the same time.

We take home some impressions of Lea and Aaron's emigration experience - from the cozy comforts of their home, Aaron's love of Canada, Lea's enthusiasm for icebergs, the picturesque hiking trails right on their doorstep to the warm hospitality of the locals. The latter were delighted to welcome the couple: everyone knew "the Germans" in the village and we were asked several times how they ended up in Brighton - and that for several months.

We return home with many wonderful memories in our luggage. We will always remember the great time of friendship, the business sense of our landlords, the long return journey, the beauty of nature and the warmth of the people who accompanied us on this trip. Special thanks to Lea for our wonderful friendship!
