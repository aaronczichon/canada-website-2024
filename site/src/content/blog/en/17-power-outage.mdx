Yesterday was a bit of a hectic day.  
Our landlady wrote to us at 12:00 pm to say that the electricity would be switched off from 1-7pm.  
This presented us a few challenges. Luckily, Lea only had a lecture until 12:45pm, but two counseling sessions from 1:30pm.  
So, we had to eat lunch quickly and then get in the car and look for mobile phone reception.  
The thing is: without landline internet, we hardly have any mobile reception where we currently live. At least not enough to make good use of it.

The apartment cooled down considerably over the afternoon (as we also use electricity for heating, of course), the notebook batteries ran low (but were sufficient) and it got a bit dark towards the evening.  
Shopping wasn't possible either, as the grocery store couldn't take a card, so we had to prepare coffee in the traditional way, with a fire, like on a hike.

Many of the Canadians then fired up their diesel generators to pass the time. That seems to happen quite often.  
This in turn shows us very clearly that we in Germany are spoiled by a stable power grid. If we have a power cut there for 20-30 minutes, that's a long time.
Here it is probably no problem to turn off the power for 6 hours in the middle of the day and carry out work on the power lines.

Germany is one of the countries with the most stable power grids in the world. Only [Lichtenstein and Slovenia](https://cubeconcepts.de/saidi-deutsches-stromnetz-weiterhin-stabil/) are ahead of it.
