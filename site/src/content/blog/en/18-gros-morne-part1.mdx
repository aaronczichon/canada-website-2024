> We have again divided our experiences from Gros Morne into several blog posts. This is part 1 from Thursday, our arrival and the Baker's Brook Trail.

Last weekend we went to Gros Morne National Park for a few days. On Thursday afternoon after work, we set off in the direction of Deer Lake and Gros Morne. Fortunately, the national park is only about a 3-hour drive from Brighton, which is almost next door by Canadian standards.

First, we drove to our accommodation in Rocky Harbour to check in. The landlady there gave us a very friendly welcome and showed us around the accommodation. She first apologized to us that the television in the apartment we had booked didn't work and therefore gave us an upgrade. We were given a larger apartment with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen and living room. Of course we couldn't say no to that. Even if we didn't need television at all.

We had planned a tight program for the days. After arriving at 5:30pm, we set off again to hike the trail at Baker's Brook Fall. The long daylight hours are slowly playing into our hands, so it's still possible to hike late in the evening. The sun now sets at 9:07pm.  
The entire route, including the outward and return journey, is about 10km long.

Unfortunately, the weather wasn't so good, and it kept raining in between.  
As we were out so late in the evening, we kept talking about whether we might see a moose.  
As a reminder, we had only seen one moose near Brighton up to that point.

Suddenly, however, Lea is all excited and pulls out her cell phone to take one (or many) photos.  
There's a moose standing right by the side of the road, eating comfortably. About 10 meters away from us.  
When he notices us, he stares at us for a while, and we stare back. No one knew exactly what to do.  
But then at some point he turned his head away from us and continued to eat. We then assumed that he wasn't a danger to us and that we weren't a danger to him either.

After the hike, we went for a meal in Rocky Harbour and then actually went straight to bed. It was an exhausting day.
