The next morning, Friday, we first went to the small caf√© nearby. We had a relaxed breakfast there.  
After breakfast, we started our program for the day. We had booked tickets for the boat trip into the fjord on Thursday evening.

This boat tour started at 12:30pm. However, you still have to walk about 30-45 minutes from the parking lot to the landing stage. That's why we set off at 11am.

The boat tour was fun. Even though it was a "classic tourist activity", we were able to see a lot. Under other circumstances, this would have been difficult or even impossible.  
After the tour, we each had a chili at the dock and then headed back towards the car.

After thinking about it for a while, we decided to postpone the Tablelands until Sunday and do the trail to Gros Morne (mountain) in the afternoon.

We did the first part of the Gros Morne Trail here. The upper part, up the mountain, is unfortunately closed in May and June. Wildlife is protected there currently and hiking is not allowed.

All in all, this day was also very strenuous as we walked several kilometers again!
