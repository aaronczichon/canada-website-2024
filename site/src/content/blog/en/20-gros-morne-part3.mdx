After an eventful Thursday and Friday, Saturday was a little more relaxed.  
The weather forecast for the day was bad, and it lived up to expectations.  
Just as well for us that we had planned to spend the day driving to the northernmost part of Newfoundland. After breakfast in the caf√©, we set off in the direction of St. Anthony.

On the way, we stopped at Arches Provincial Park. Over the centuries, rocks there have been washed through in such a way that holes have formed in them.  
You can also find different small stones with the most beautiful colors and patterns on the beach.

Before we drove on to St. Anthony, we briefly unloaded our things at the lodge where we spent the night from Saturday to Sunday.  
We were the only guests that weekend and had the whole guest house to ourselves.  
It was a classic lodge with a few rooms, lots of wood and large communal areas. Just the style we like.  
The owners were super friendly and even catered breakfast for us on Sunday.

Unfortunately, we weren't so lucky with the weather in St. Anthony and the surrounding area. In addition to the rain, there was also heavy fog. This thwarted our goal of seeing lots of icebergs.  
We were still able to see one or two icebergs. However, after the weekend we realized that the northern part of the Longrange Mountains wasn't really worth it and that we should have spent another day in Gros Morne National Park instead. But you only know that afterwards.

As we had a long return journey on Sunday (about 6 hours), we decided to divide the trip into 2 stages.  
3 hours back to Gros Morne National Park and a visit to the Tablelands. These had been on our list all along and were to be the final highlight of the trip.

Even though we were better prepared for the hike to the Tablelands than usual, unfortunately the weather also threw a spanner in the works.  
After being dry for most of the day, we were hit by rain in the middle of the ascent. Unfortunately, we had to abandon the ascent for safety reasons.  
But that's only half as bad, as we were still able to enjoy a wonderful view and it felt almost unreal to walk on the earth's mantle.

## Canada üá®üá¶ Facts ‚úîÔ∏è

**Today: Tablelands of Newfoundland**  
We haven't had a "Canada Facts" section for a long time. Today we are back.  
The topic is the Tablelands. These are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and are unique in the world.

They owe their barren and rocky appearance to plate tectonics. Normally, you only ever see what is known as the Earth's crust, i.e. the outermost part of the Earth.  
There are only a few places in the world where the earth's mantle is as exposed as it is here. We have plate tectonics to thank for this. The Tablelands were therefore the first place where plate tectonics could be proven.  
The rock is yellowish or ochre-colored and consists of peridotite. This rock contains a lot of iron and is therefore very heavy.  
The peridotite makes it almost impossible for plants to grow on the tablelands. You can see this clearly in our pictures. A few robust plants only grow where the meltwater from the mountains flows down and finds its way.
