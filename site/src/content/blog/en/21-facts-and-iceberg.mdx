We want to share some interesting facts about Newfoundland with you:

**What animals live on Newfoundland?**  
There are around 120,000 moose, 6,000 to 10,000 black bears, numerous beavers, reindeer, squirrels and puffins living on Newfoundland. There used to be no moose on the island, they were brought to the island in 1907 and the population increased enormously. Last year, polar bears were also spotted, which came with the icebergs from Greenland or Labrador. Numerous whales can be spotted along the coast.

**Why does Newfoundland have significantly lower temperatures, even though it is no further north than Berlin?**  
Our village in Newfoundland is geographically located at approximately the same latitude as Berlin. In May, it is between 0 and 13 degrees in Brighton (the village where we currently live). It is therefore significantly cooler on average than in Berlin in May. In July and August, the average temperature is between 9 and 24 degrees.  
In winter, the temperatures are between -2 and -15. The reason for the cool temperatures is the Gulf Stream, the water cools down in the Arctic waters and sinks into the depths, the cold water flows to the south.

**What attraction is Newfoundland known for?**  
Between May and July, icebergs drift from Greenland (from the huge glaciers) to the coast of Newfoundland. The icebergs are over 10,000 years old and take up to two years to travel from Greenland to Newfoundland. On the coast of Newfoundland, they dock on the ground ("the iceberg is grounded"), only when they melt do they continue their journey and drift into other bays. The ice can show different colors, depending on how compacted the ice is (snow white, light blue, ...).  
The ice is very heavy and very cold. Some fishermen here on Newfoundland pull the icebergs ashore or collect the so-called "bergy bits" (chunks of ice) to melt water from them and sell the water. The iceberg water is very tasty (it really tastes like nothing, so it's completely natural). I was very fascinated by the icebergs, the colors, the shape and their changes are impressive. Take a look at the video!

**How large is Newfoundland?**  
Newfoundland is about the size of France or Spain. About 492,000 people live here on Newfoundland. It is about 900 km from the south-westernmost town of Channel-Port aux Basques to St. Johns (south-east) and about 700 km to St. Anthony (northernmost town). The coastline is 9,656 km long. Together with Labrador, the coastline is 17,542 km long. In comparison: the coastline of the Baltic and North Sea is 2,389 km.

**What is the history of Newfoundland?**  
From around 1700 BC to modern times, various First Nations groups such as the Beothuk and Micmac were present on the island. It is said that the Vikings discovered the island around 1000 AD. In 1961, a Viking settlement was discovered in the north of the island, L'Anse aux Meadows. We also visited this settlement. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  
Newfoundland was then explored by John Cabot (Italian navigator) in 1497. In the 17th century, the British and French competed for the island. In 1713, they made peace, and the British took over the island. However, France wanted to keep the island of St. Pierre and Miquelon for fishing purposes. This island in the south of Newfoundland is still part of France, so you can take a short trip over to Europe.

**What do the Newfoundlanders (Newfies) do for a living?**  
Fishing, oil extraction and mining are the main jobs in Newfoundland. As the fishing grounds are slowly being depleted, tourism is becoming increasingly important for the Newfies.
