Our time in Brighton is slowly coming to an end. At the end of next week, on Saturday to be precise, we'll be moving on towards St. John's.

We are currently taking on the last trails in the area that we haven't done yet. These include, for example, the [Hazelnut Hill Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/newfoundland-and-labrador/hazelnut-hill-trail) and the [Indian River Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/newfoundland-and-labrador/indian-river-trail).

As the weather is great now (yes, you could say summery at 28 degrees!), we decided to walk the Indian River Trail in the late afternoon after work.

It's a relaxed trail along the Indian River in Springdale. The only thing that currently bothers us on our hikes are the countless mosquitoes, which Canada is (unfortunately) also known for.  
So of course, the first thing we did was go and buy some mosquito spray. Spoiler: It doesn't do much good. You have to spray yourself with it about 2-3 times per hike.

The trail itself was not very challenging as it does not include any elevation gain. However, with its length of 10km, it does require some stamina.

As we were already relatively late, the corresponding coffee break by the river was also later than usual. However, the setting by the river on a warm early evening was hard to beat.

To give the day a special finish, our landlords Gerald and Loretta took us out on the boat.

Gerald had spent the last few days and weeks preparing his boat for the summer and now the time had finally come. The weather was good, and we were able to see "our" iceberg up close one last time.

Luckily, we kept our distance from the iceberg and went to see Bear Cave. At the same time, the mountain turned again.

It is quite normal for an iceberg to turn several times (even several times a day). As the lower part melts, the mountain with the heavier, upper part tilts again at some point. This is usually repeated until the berg is either really flat on one side or until it has melted and is just an ice floe.

Bear Cove is so named because it is a silhouette of a bear. This is particularly easy to see in the early hours of the morning when the sun shines on the rocks at the right angle.

Whether we will be allowed out on the boat again in the next few days will depend on the time and weather conditions.
