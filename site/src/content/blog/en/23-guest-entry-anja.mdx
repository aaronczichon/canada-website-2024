After it was just getting warm in Germany in mid-May and you could enjoy the first few days in shorts, I was looking forward to the much cooler Newfoundland. But anyone who knows me is not at all surprised. So, the suitcases were packed and my hat and gloves flew in with them.

After a smooth flight with a stopover in Montreal, I arrived in St. Johns, Newfoundland, on May 18. On my first walk to the supermarket, I realized that despite my hat and gloves, it was bitterly cold (which fortunately would change in the coming days). What I also noticed on the way to the supermarket was that I was the only one walking to the supermarket. I was yet to learn why and what the long distances might have to do with it.

But first I would like to tell you about my rental car. When I booked a car a few weeks ago, I was surprised that no small cars were on offer. I had therefore opted for a medium-sized car at the time. When I arrived at the rental car station at the airport, I was initially surprised by the size of the car. I had imagined a medium-sized car to be smaller. However, when I drove off and was on the road a lot over the next few days, I realized that my rental car was one of the smaller ones. Most of the cars were much larger and the SUVs you see on the roads in Germany would also look small in Newfoundland. I set off and once I had got used to the automatic gearbox, everything went very smoothly. The roads in Newfoundland are empty and with a maximum speed of 100 km/h, everything seems rather leisurely.  
After my first night in St. Johns and a brief tour of the town and its Jelly Bean Rows as well as a nearby lighthouse, I headed west from kilometer 0 on the Trans Canada Highway.  
For the fact that Newfoundland looks like a small island off the Canadian mainland on the maps, it is very large; as big as Spain in comparison (as Lea and Aaron told me later). A quick drive from St. Johns to Brighton to visit Lea and Aaron is not an option; you have to reckon with an easy 6-hour drive. As I had seen a lot on my first day in St. Johns, I decided to split the trip in two and stay another night in Clarenville. Because there are also some special features to see there. By "there", however, I don't mean a short detour to a place of interest in the area, but rather another 3 hours I was on the road to see all my destinations. But as with all the distances I have covered, it's really worth it! And not just because of the destinations, but also because of the way there: forests and lakes and forests and lakes, uphill and downhill and in between always a view of the sea. After so many lakes, I have theorized that the ratio of people to lakes in Newfoundland is 1:1.  
But now back to Clarenville and its "nearby" destinations: First stop was the Tickle Cove Sea Arch, a rugged red washed-out rock. As I was to learn later from Lea and Aaron, the red color is related to the large iron deposit. I thought it was pretty.

I continued on to Keels. In Keels I realized for the first time how much at the end of the world I was, hardly any houses and as deserted as the place looked, you could certainly feel lonely here. Of course, this could also have something to do with the fact that there are so-called devil tracks in a rock here. But even if my technical geological English wasn't enough to fully understand the information board, I can reassure everyone that these are of course not "devil's tracks", but it's still a crazy geological occurrence.

My third destination for this afternoon is St. Trinity Church on the other side of the arm of land out into the sea. Google Maps suggested two routes for this. Either "around the outside" along the coast or across the inland. Both were supposed to take the same amount of time, but the inland route was the shorter one in terms of kilometers... well, what can I say, I got to know Newfoundland in a different way: of course I chose the inland route.  
Google Maps had to be wrong about the time. Surprise: Of course I was wrong and spent 45 minutes torturing myself through a pothole-ridden road at a maximum speed of 30 km/h. I drove more in serpentine lines than straight ahead and only saw a hare instead of people and other cars.  
On the other side, however, the pretty little town of Trinity was waiting for me.

On the way back, I came to a police checkpoint. After the policeman examined my driver's license for a few minutes, although he said he had never seen a German driver's license before, I was allowed to pass without any problems.

The next day, however, I actually went to see Lea and Aaron. I was really looking forward to seeing them. Oh yes, I had already mentioned the end of the world earlier, so I can only say: Welcome to Brighton!  
Brighton was now my home for the next 1.5 weeks and I felt very much at home there. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Lea and Aaron once again for their great hospitality. Your enthusiasm for Canada is absolutely infectious and I am very grateful that I was able to get to know a part of this wonderful country thanks to you.

Having only just arrived at their place, I was already infected by their enthusiasm for icebergs. Before long, there was nothing more exciting for me than going iceberg hunting. Fortunately, the first berg was within sight of their house and when I drove into the town of Brighton, it took my breath away. How beautiful and sad it is at the same time that this iceberg found its way to Brighton. Beautiful, because there is no other adjective to describe its sheer shape and mightiness, and the shapes and structures surprise you every day anew. Sad, because the long journey soon comes to an end with the arrival in Brighton and the millennia-old water disappears forever into the Atlantic. Even if the iceberg migration already existed before climate change, you realize what beauty and livelihood we are destroying with our actions and behaviour.  
Over the next 1.5 weeks, in addition to the typical questions in the morning such as "Did you sleep well?", the question "Is the iceberg still there?" was always important. Fortunately, during my time in Newfoundland, yes, even though it still had a few kilometers to go and changed its shape what felt like a hundred times.

In addition to several day trips, another highlight of my trip was our joint trip to the western and northern parts of Newfoundland. You can read all the stories on Lea and Aaron's blog, so I'll just mention one small thing here. In addition to iceberg fever, after our hike to Baker's Brook Falls and the sighting of a moose, we also got moose-fever. After 4 days in the western and northern part of Newfoundland, we actually had to keep a list of how many icebergs, moose and then reindeer we had seen...more than once we stopped in the middle of the highway for icebergs and moose and even turned around.

As I write these sentences, I look back on my time in Newfoundland with a smile. And before I get wanderlust, I'd better stop here.

On my way home, I stopped off in Toronto for two more days - there could hardly be a greater contrast to Newfoundland, but that's another story.

PS: Say hello to my little bird friend :-)
