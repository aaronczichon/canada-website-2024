After nearly 2 months it is time to say goodbye to Brighton and the region with a heavy heart . There are some exciting days ahead of us. We're going to St. John's!  
But before that we will stay one night, from Saturday to Sunday, at Trinity. We hope we can get a closer look to the Puffins and we will do another whale watching tour.

<DirectusImage assetId="b4ae8f02-e98e-4e23-bd63-8955be9e5baf.jpeg" />> We've
done the last thing on our list on Wednesday: visiting the Sperm Whale Pavilion.

On Sunday we currently planning to do a hike in the region of Trinity and then arriving in the early evening in St. John's so that we're there on the 1st of July.  
It's important to us that we're in a city on the 1st of July because that's one of the most important, if not the most important, public holiday: Canada Day!  
So we don't want to miss related events and the fireworks in the evening.

Before we heading back to Nova Scotia with the ferry on the 18th of July we have something special on our list, but we will keep you updated on this one.

miss this stunning landscapes.

We will definitely often remember our time in Brighton. We have met so many nice people here. Everyone was so welcoming, had to something to tell, answered our questions or just a simple good chat.  
We get to know the Green Bay region very well and had so much great experiences like see many Moose, great views and hiking tracks and, of course, "our" iceberg right in front of the house.  
If there is to much noise in the western part of Canada on our next months we might come backt to beautiful Newfoundland.

We looking forward to come back here again.  
A huge thanks goes also to our hosts Loretta and Gerald. They welcomed us so warmly and made us feel like home. It was such a pleasure!
