After a long flight including a grueling 10-hour stopover in London (we definitely cannot recommend an overnight stay at Heathrow Airport), the landing approach over Canada was already spectacular. The view from the plane gave us a first impression of the unknown vastness of Newfoundland with dense, seemingly impenetrable forests and untouched nature that was not even interrupted by individual roads. This fascinating landscape continued right up to our destination of Halifax: no infrastructure or inhabited areas could be seen through the porthole of the plane, so we briefly expected to land in the middle of the forest on an unpaved fort road. Finally, at the last moment, a metal fence appeared separating the forest from the paved runway of the airport and we touched Canadian soil for the first time. As soon as we arrived at Halifax airport, we could feel the calm and relaxed atmosphere here - there were no people rushing around or stressed out. Everything was really slowed down and very relaxed. The perfect atmosphere to start a relaxed vacation full of relaxation! Even after entering the country, the locals made the best impression: all passers-by were very friendly and immediately offered to help with directions. However, the highlight of the small airport was the integrated fresh fish and lobster counter, where various types of fish and seafood were offered for sale chilled on ice. This unique sight made us realize that we really had just landed in Canada!

Looking outside towards the parking garage, we were again amazed: unlike at home, there seemed to be only pick-ups, SUVs and really big boxes on the road here. A Smart, small Corso or even a mid-range car was nowhere to be found among the parked cars. Even on the visitor parking strip, the suitcases of the other travelers were stowed exclusively in particularly spacious XXL-sized vehicles. Unlike most of the other arrivals from the airport, we took the bus together with Lea, who kindly picked us up, to get into the city. The journey to downtown Halifax took about an hour and took us along a highway through lush woodland. We also passed a few lakes with pretty little wooden huts nestled in the forest right on the shore - the typical image that pops into your head as a cliché as soon as you think of Canada! Enthusiastically, we immediately tried to capture the scenery in a photo from the rocking bus, but Lea only said that we would see this everywhere here and would therefore still have plenty of opportunity to take pictures.

When we arrived in Halifax, we moved into our Air BNB in the middle of a nice residential area about 10 minutes' walk from Lea and Aaron's accommodation and freshened up, which was more than necessary after the long journey. Afterwards, we had to fight a tough battle against our jet lag, which was constantly trying to get us to sleep. However, after we were invited to dinner at Lea and Aaron's, we were motivated enough to finally win the battle and stay awake a little longer. We were definitely rewarded for this: Aaron prepared Canadian-style burgers with onions caramelized in maple syrup. This was accompanied by a huge portion of fries and ginger ale - and the comment from Lea that Aaron "can now (emphasis added!) prepare the burger quite well". After this tasty introduction to typical Canadian cuisine, we were later able to walk home refreshed and finally give in to our jet lag and fall into bed.

The next morning we were fit again and after a leisurely breakfast in the Air BNB communal kitchen
(which we had just for ourselves for the whole vacation) we were ready to set off to explore the
area. After Lea and Aaron had to work, we set off on our own towards the bus route to visit a
shopping center on the outskirts of the city and get an impression of the different parts of the city on
the way there. The bus system was quite inexpensive and easy to use - ideal for newcomers to
Canada, even without much preparation. We were amazed at the many beautiful wooden houses
throughout the city with their great facades, which were all individually and colorfully designed and
shone in every imaginable color and couldn't stop snapping one picture after another. There were
also Canada-specific highlights to be found in the shopping center: we cuddled up with an oversized
XXL beaver for a selfie in the roots store and bought warm Canada hoodies in a partner look.

In the evening, we explored the beautiful harbor together with Lea and Aaron and immersed
ourselves in Halifax's gastronomy and nightlife. With so many restaurants, takeaways and bars of all
kinds, there really was something for everyone. Halifax literally invited you to discover a new location
every evening. Later in the evening, we ended up at Lea and Aaron's favorite pub for a drink. The
boys ordered beer. As the cider on the menu was unfortunately off, the girls had to change their
plans. When we asked the waiter what he could recommend as an alternative, he enthusiastically
named a drink that we had never heard of before, but which was nice and fruity and would taste
great. So we trusted his recommendation and were excited to see what he would serve. We were all
the more surprised when we saw what he put on the table: it was a wheat beer in a wheat glass with
a slice of orange on the rim - this was quite unusual (not only for the Bavarian in the group) and
caused plenty of laughter for the rest of the evening!

The next day we made our way to Peggy's Cove, a former picturesque fishing village on the coast
with a famous lighthouse. We quickly realized that in Canada, even for such day trips or "short
excursions", more than enough driving time has to be planned and 2 to 3 hours one way are not
uncommon. Once we arrived, we were initially hit by the cold coastal wind, which makes it essential
to pack full gear to protect yourself against the cold. However, we were rewarded by the fantastic
view of the historic fishing village and the lighthouse on the rocky coast right by the sea. As it was
still off-season, there were hardly any other tourists around, so we had the village almost entirely to
ourselves and were able to take as many pictures as we wanted without having to crop other people
out of the photos. Afterwards, we went for lunch in the local restaurant and treated ourselves to a
lobster sandwich and a lobster roll - both were served with a huge pile of fries, as is typical in
Canada.

Strengthened, we continued on to Lunenburg, a beautiful little harbor town with a long tradition of
fishing and shipbuilding and beautiful house facades in all colors along the coast and across the city.
From bright red to purple, turquoise or quintessential yellow, all colors were represented here
among the wooden houses and villas.

We spent the next few days exploring Halifax and the surrounding area by day and by night. Among
other things, we visited the Farmers Market at the harbor with all its regional and international
delicacies, drank a beer or two and cider in the Irish and Scottish pubs and explored a multicultural
market with food and articles from all over the world, especially excellent rum cake from the
Bahamas. With this fantastic, exotic offer, we realized once again what a cultural melting pot Canada
is.

After just under a week, the time had finally come to move on with our journey. Finally, we had a
pancake breakfast in Halifax to celebrate Wolfi's birthday before setting off on our tour north
towards Newfoundland.
2,500 kilometers lay ahead of us. The further north we went, the lonelier it became and the number
of trees to the right and left of the road increased disproportionately. It was one thing to see the
vastness of nature from an airplane. Driving through these areas by car
and experiencing the incredible expanse of the forests here was something completely different. We
had never seen so many trees in our lives and the forests didn't seem to want to end in any
direction. At our first stop on a stretch of beach very close to our first destination for the day, we
quickly realized that it had become a lot fresher with the distance we had covered. The icy coastal
wind on the beach blew mercilessly and made it clear that you couldn't do without a hat here! As we
were not used to this harsh climate, our blue lips when shopping in the local supermarket soon
revealed that we were not locals but tourists and the cashier started a conversation about the
weather with a grin and curiously asked where we had come from.

However, the pretty Air BNB cottage we had booked for the night nearby was fortunately equipped
with a hot tub, so we were able to end the evening with beer and cider in the hot water and warm
up again. The next day, we continued on winding roads through huge national parks and went on
our first hike together on a previously researched trail. Before we could start the hiking route, a
warning sign next to the map in the parking lot informed us that bears, moose and coyotes could be
found in the forest. We eagerly set off, but didn't encounter any wild animals, only their droppings,
which meant we had to balance over several piles of moose. After the long walk, we had to make
the last stretch of the journey to the coast, from where we took the night ferry to Newfoundland in
the evening. Fortunately, there were no other guests in Lea and Aaron's four-person cabin, so the
four of us were able to sleep in one cabin and all in real beds. So the next morning we saw the coast
of Newfoundland relatively well-rested.
