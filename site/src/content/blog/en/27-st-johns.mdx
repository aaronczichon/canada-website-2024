## Arrival and Canada Day

It is the capital of Newfoundland and covers an area of nearly 450,000 square kilometers, making it nearly 1/3 the size of Munich, Germany.  
One thing to keep in mind: St. John's has only about 110.000 habitants. Munich has 1,5 million habitants.
As mentioned in a previous blog post, Newfoundland has only about 530.000 habitants on an area like the size of Spain. And about 1/5 of the habitants live in St. John's.

We stayed 13 days in St. John's. It was enough time to get to know and see the surrounding area. Which was a stroke of luck for us: We had the ideal weather most of the time. It was sunny, warm, but not too hot.

Our arrival was filled with a full evening program at the Street Festival on George Street on June 30th. There we celebrated the Canada Day (first of July) with a big party.  
At the next day, it took place the most important national holiday day: Canada Day!  
Canada always celebrates its birthday with a lot of programs and activities. Therefore, at the afternoon, we visited a sport center where you could eat free cupcakes and participate in some events.  
Later we went to the Pedestrian Mall downtown.

Being back in a city also has the advantage that you can visit great pubs in the evenings. Like in Halifax, you can feel the big impact of Ireland and Scottland here in St. John's. This is also reflected in the pubs.

## Signal Hill and the Battery

For sure we can't miss to visit the Signal Hill and the Battery. The Signal Hill today offers a wonderful view over the sea and St. John's. In the past it was an important defense point for the city. As the harbor can only be reached through the strait between Signal Hill and the opposite hill, St. John's was a well defensible city.  
The most famous thing in St. John's are the many colorful houses, which are part of the World Heritage Site. The residents are particularly proud of their “Battery”. This is a collection of houses built into the rock below Signal Hill.

## La Manche and the East Coast Trail

We used the weekend to get out of the city and do some day trips to the peninsulas in the south. On Saturday, the 6th of July we drove to La Manche Provincial Parc to hike a part of the East Cost Hiking Trail. The trail runs for several kilometers along the coast and offers wonderful landscapes and cliffs as well as great views along the sea.  
On the way back we made a stop at the also very famous Cape Spear.  
Cape Spear is the easternmost point of Canada and the closest point to Europe.

## Bird Rock and whales at the beach

Sunday was a classic day in Newfoundland. It was completed covered with fog. On top of that there was some heavy rain.  
But that didn't stop us from driving to Cape St. Mary's. There is the famous “Bird Rock”. A rock or a cliff where hundreds, if not thousands of birds have their home.  
Arriving in the midst of fog and rain, we almost considered returning on the parking lot. However, Lea insisted on at least having a look inside the building, which was recognizable by its outline.  
As we found out, that it was a tourist information, which was even open. There we were assured that you could see and observe the birds very well in spite of the fog. We weren't disappointed of the advices which we got from the touristic information. We could observe the birds really good and with the fog it was a beautiful picture.

We got the advice to take a detour on the way back to St. Vincent's. Like they told us, you can observe humbacks from the beach there. We followed the suggestion although it was a detour of about two hours for us. It show us again, that you get the best information from the locals. We actually could observe several humpbacks.

## Quidi Vidi

The following days, the weather did its best to give us a nice visit. We were able to go on the beach after work. We could get used to it. The next day we visited the little village Quidi Vidi, on the outskirts of St. John's, and ist lake Quidi Vidi.

## Auf bald, St. John's!

All in all we had a wonderful stay in St. John's. Also here one could consider to come back still once. The city is large but not overcrowded.  
As always in Canada, you are quickly in the nature and with Signal Hill, the Battery and Quidi Vidi, you have the feeling to be in the village. Only with the advantages of the oceans and the beautiful landscapes.

Canada-Facts: Today, St. John's Fact: Pedestrian Mall
The concept of a pedestrian zone does not really exist in Canadian cities. Since Canadians are known to like to drive their cars directly to somewhere, this would not be good for business.  
However, they have realized that people like to walk through the town when the weather is nice. That is why St. John's has the Pedestrian Mall in the summer (July - September). Two sections of the street are closed to the traffic. This is the concept of a mobile pedestrian zone where events and markets take place.

## Video

Like last time, we have captured the time in St. John's in a video.
