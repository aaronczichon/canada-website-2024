We arrived in our next accommodation at Arnold's Cove last Friday in the afternoon. We stayed there for 3 nights until we continued on Monday towards Marystown.  
We decided to do a trail, which we can start right from the apartment. The trail was approximately 8km along beaches and shores.  
On Saturday we where pretty lucky with the weather. It was sunning and the temperatures rose over 28 degrees. Therefore we decided we want to do a beach day. First we drove to Eastport and to Salvage, a nice and small fishermen’s town. Before we went to a beach, we have done a trail in Salvage, the Net Point Trail which gave us a wonderful view on the cove and the town.

Afterwards we drove to the beach which was, in terms of Newfoundland, kind'a crowded. We actually tried to go swimming but the ocean was really cold. The water temperature is currently around 11 degrees. So We only got in there once or twice for a few moments.  
On Sunday we wanted to do another trail (as it was sunny but not so hot as the day before). That's why we drove to Change Cove. There we hiked a trail which was really beautiful with great lookouts to the coves and beaches.

After a short coffee break walked on the cove of Arnold's Cove called The War Path. There we also could watch a few Balt Eagles in their nest.
