## Questions and answers about Newfoundland

What was your best experience in Newfoundland?  
Aaron: The Gros Morne National Park with the Tablelands.  
Lea: To be able to accompany the iceberg's journey for five weeks.

Which of the 9 accommodations did we like best?  
Aaron: I thought the lodge in Mainbrook was the coolest, Brighton had the best equipment, and Marystown had the best internet.  
Lea: I thought the accommodation in Brighton was the best because Gerald and Loretta took care of us and we were able to gain a lot of insight into the Newfoundland culture of a fishing village.

What was the best trail for us?  
Aaron: The Coastal Trail in Chance Cove was the best in terms of weather and views.  
Lea: The Beothuk Trail on Long Island was very beautiful, which is why we walked it twice. There we discovered the first iceberg.

What was the most difficult thing for us during our time in Newfoundland?  
Aaron: Switching the accommodations during working hours.  
Lea: The power outage that was announced half an hour before and I still had a lecture and two clients. I panicked for a moment :D

Where did we drink the best coffee?  
Aaron: In the Jumping-Bean Caf√© in St. John's.
Lea: Cappuccino at Tim Hortens, because with the normal Americano you can't drink the last sips anymore because it's so bitter.

What evenings will we not forget?  
Aaron: The lobster dinner and the barbecue with sauna evening.  
Lea: The lobster dinner with Larissa and Jason (the landlords of Fredi and Chris Airbnb) and the game evenings with our friends (Wolfi, Laura, Fredi, Chris, and Anja). Watching the sunsets was also very nice.

Which day trip did we like best?  
Aaron: The day trip to Twillingate.  
Lea: The day trip to St. Mary's to watch the birds and then to watch the whales on the beach in St. Vincents (even though the weather was very rainy and foggy).

Which after-work activities did we like best?  
Aaron: When we did the Indian Falls Brook Trail after work and then came home to Brighton to visit our iceberg up close with the boat for the last time.  
Lea: I also found this to be the nicest activity after work. Although I also liked our visit to the whale museum because a local teacher told us about the life of a sperm whale for 1.5 hours and we were able to exchange ideas about Newfoundland culture.

What food tasted best to us?  
Aaron: I liked the pit stops with poutine (fries with gravy and cheese) and loaded fries (fries with bacon, onion, cheese, and sauce) the best.  
Lea: I liked the moose soup, the pancakes on Long Island (which we ate three times :D), and the fish tacos the best.

Which place did we like best (village or town)?  
Aaron: I liked the village of Quidi Vidi the best.  
Lea: Besides Brighton (where we lived for 2 months), I also liked Salvage and Trinity.

## Canada üá®üá¶ Facts ‚úîÔ∏è

**Today: Infrastructure of Newfoundland**  
Our landlord told us that his father and even his grandfather grew up in Brighton. He said that until the 1970s there was no road leading to Brighton. Only from the 1970s onwards were all fishing villages connected to the infrastructure. I find it really incredible to imagine that before that, apart from possibly by boat or on foot, you couldn't leave the village. The teacher who currently volunteers at the whale museum in Triton told us that he also grew up in Triton. When he finished school and went to university in St. John's, it was a culture shock for him. He had never been in such a big city before (St. John's has about 110,000 inhabitants).  
The locals were able to leave their places (to study, for work) through the infrastructure and tourism was able to slowly build up. But you can tell that apart from the car, there is no infrastructure yet. Without a car, you can't get far. Within the two months and 21 days, we drove a total of 7,800km.
