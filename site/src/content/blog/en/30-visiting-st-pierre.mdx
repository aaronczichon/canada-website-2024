Now we arrived in Montreal.  
Before we tell this story (especially the great train journey), we like to tell you from the last week, more specific, from last Wednesday (17.07.). At this day we travelled to France, by ferry, completely with entering and leaving the EU and returning to Canada.

But we start at the beginning. In front of the coast of Newfoundland, there is the island group consisting of 2 islands, St. Pierre & Miquelon.  
Like others, large parts of Canada, the island group was also part of the French colony.  
However, when the French handed over Newfoundland to the British, the condition at the time was, that everything would be handed over to the Commonwealth with the exception of these two islands.

Around the islands there were a very big fish area. The fish population was extremely high in comparison to other parts in the region. Therefore, France liked to keep these two islands.  
So they belong to France till today. You can reach them by ferry from Fortune (Newfoundland) or by plane from St. John's or Paris.  
We chose the ferry. We planned a day trip to the island. In the morning with the ferry at 09:0am and with the ferry at 05:00pm back to Newfoundland.  
Unfortunately, we left Fortune 1.5 hours late and we arrived on the island shortly after 12 noon. Therefore, we had only 4 hours on the island St. Pierre.

As the island belong to France, you have to do the whole process with entering in the EU, leaving and returning again in Canada. We initially were looking forward to get a stamp in St. Pierre in our passports. But as we were entering the EU and we have an European passport, we were the only ones, who didn’t get a stamp. Only when we returned to Canada we got one for Canada.

We directly recognized that we are in France, because we could pay with Euro, there was a 230V power supply and, when we arrived, everyone took a lunch break from 12 noon to 2pm. Which was very surprising for a place that now only lives from tourism.

We ate a French croissant, rent two bikes and we discovered the small island with the bike. There were no doubt that we are in North America than in France cause of the construction methods, the cars and all others. Summarized St. Pierre is like a French trimmed, Canadian village, which we would except in Quebec.

The way back was very excited for us.  
Most of the other people had surely a Canadian passport and could enter Canada without problems. Also all, who came from St. Pierre with a French passport and a touristic visa of 90 days, hadn’t any problems.  
However, since we had to specify, that we plan to stay still 218 days in Canada, we had the pleasure of a special examination. First, our bags were controlled and then we were asked, why we like to stay so long in Canada. When we answered that we are in Canada with the working holiday visa, they wanted to see our documents. Unfortunately, the documents were in our accommodation. But we had an online version on our mobile phones.  
This was sufficient for the officer to check with the number, if our visa is valid and we are allowed to re-enter Candada.  
They wished us a nice evening after 15-20 minutes of inspection and we were fortunately allowed to enter Canada again. Meanwhile the whole frontier area was already empty and we were the last ones.

Aaron also created a video of the trip:
