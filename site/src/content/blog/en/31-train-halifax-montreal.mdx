We changed our location in the country once more for the coming weeks.  
After a quiet and relaxed time, we are now heading back to a city, to Montréal in Québec.  
We didn't want to cover every distance by car or plane. That's why we booked the train for the route from Halifax to Montréal.

The "The Ocean" by VIA Rail takes 23h and 30min (officially) from Halifax to Montréal twice a week, always on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  
This means that you can comfortably board at 11:30 a.m. in Halifax and arrive in Montréal at 10:00 a.m. the next morning.  
For the journey, we booked a 2-person sleeping cabin to make the journey as pleasant as possible.  
And what can we say, we were not disappointed!

Right from the "check-in", you can tell that the journey is designed to be as comfortable as possible for the guest.  
You can check in your larger pieces of luggage and then receive your wristband and voucher for lunch for the "Sleeper Plus" class.  
If you have booked a sleeping cabin, you will receive a 3-course meal (lunch, dinner, and breakfast) on the journey from Halifax to Montréal.  
For each meal, you can choose between 3 main courses. Before that, there is either soup or salad and dessert.

On board the train, you are first greeted personally and given a brief introduction to the cabin.  
Our cabin had a large sofa and a small washroom (toilet and sink).  
The sofa serves as the lower bed at night (it is folded down) and a 2nd bed can be folded down from above.

For an even more comfortable stay, there is a service car for guests. There you can make yourself comfortable on various seating options. There is WiFi available and free water, tea, and coffee.

Before boarding, we were asked when we wanted to have lunch (there are always 2 time slots available) and after lunch, we were asked which of the available slots we wanted for dinner.  
The respective time slots are then announced by announcement and you can go to the dining car.  
The whole thing then behaves like in a real restaurant. You get a seat and a menu from which you can choose your food and drinks.

The sleeping comfort of the beds that are folded down was great. Initially, we thought it would be like in a youth hostel. However, the beds are long and really comfortable.

The next morning we could have breakfast comfortably, tidy up our cabin, and I had 1-2 meetings for work.  
For this, I always had to go to the "service car" as this is the only car with WiFi.

In Montreal, we didn't have to carry our luggage off the train, but could walk to the baggage claim area and pick up our luggage after a 10-15 minute wait.

It was a really nice and relaxed way to travel such a long distance in Canada!
