We are already halfway through our time in Montréal.  
After these 1.5 weeks, we have slowly recovered from the culture shock.  
From Newfoundland and the idyllic landscapes and low populated areas, moving to a city with millions of people was quite a contrast.

With 1.7 million inhabitants, Montréal is the second largest city in Canada.  
After Québec City, Montréal/Laval is one of the oldest cities in the country. The French settlers arrived via the Gulf of St. Lawrence and settled on the edge of the St. Lawrence River.  
Initially established as a trading post for (bear) coats, they traded with the Indigenous People from here and exported their goods to Europe.

The continent was unexplored for a very long time (for Europeans), especially the western part. Today's province of Québec, or more precisely the lower part of the province, which includes Montréal and Québec City, is the origin of the country we know today as "Canada".  
For many years, the name "Canada" only referred to the area that is now Québec, long before it was even clear how far west the continent extended.

Canada officially has 2 national languages. English and French. However, there are major regional differences. While English is spoken in most provinces, only French is spoken in Quebec.  
The only province that is bilingual at provincial level is New Brunswick.  
As Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver are very international cities, English is not a problem here either.  
However, the situation is different when you travel out of the city and meet people away from the big cities in Québec.

For us, the first days and weeks in Montréal were characterized by a heat wave. At night, temperatures barely dropped below 24 degrees and during the day, 30-33 degrees in the shade were normal.  
Not even the air conditioning in our apartment could compensate that.

Despite the contrasting program to Newfoundland, it is also nice to take part in different events such as a fireworks competition, which took place on the island in the St. Lawrence river, or the various street food festivals with a poutine or Latino theme.

We have also been able to make a few excursions again in the last few days.  
These included a visit to the small village of Chambly, Mont Tremblant and the Montréal Biosphère.

A day trip to Québec City was also included.  
Probably the oldest settler town in Canada, its old town center has the flair of a small French town.  
It almost makes you feel like you're back in Europe.  
When visiting Québec City, a visit to the Montmorency Falls is, of course, a must.  
These mighty waterfalls are a magnet for tourists, especially in summer.  
Fun fact: Montmorency Falls are even 30 meters higher than Niagara Falls.

I also visited the waterfalls on my trip in 2018.  
Back then, it was -23 to -27 degrees and you could walk on ice across the lake to the waterfall.  
Seeing the spectacle again at 32 degrees was quite something different.

If you're visiting Montréal, there's one thing you can't miss: Cirque du Soleil.  
1984 founded in Montréal, it’s probably the most famous circus in the world.  
It still has a permanent tent at the old port of Montréal and offers a great program that not only features acrobatics and art, but also storytelling throughout the show.
