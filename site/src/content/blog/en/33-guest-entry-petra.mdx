When Lea picked me up from the airport on 28th of July, I realized very quickly that I miscalculated the weather in Montreal. I didn’t think about the fact, that the St. Lorenz-Storm brings a high air humidity. The most time, the temperature was 6 degrees warmer that it should have been.  
Lea dropped me at the Airbnb, which was at the 41st floor skyscraper close to the city. During the time, when Lea worked, I discovered the surrounding area. I lived next to an eishockey stadium. Later, we strolled through the harbor and met Aaron for dinner in the old town.  
One day later I recognized on the map that there must be a shopping mall and several cafés nearby, but I couldn’t find them. Then I found the solution: There is a "undergroundcity" in Montreal. It’s a 32km tunnels system which connect metro stations, bus stations, the train station, a hundred of shops, restaurants, cinemas, and stadiums. Around 80% of all office buildings from downtown are connected in the underground city.

"RESO" (based on the French word for net) helps the residents to get to work or go shopping with as little exposure to the weather as possible, especially during the harsh long winters. The shopping mall is 3-4 floors underground. In 1960 they started to build it and till now they continue to expand it.
During the week, in which Lea visited a class at university, I spent my time in RESO and I had some conversations with some residents of Montreal. They said to me, that soon there would be a town to work upstairs and a town to meet each other and to go shopping downstaris. In summer the parks will still be full of people.

I got off with Lea to Mont Tremblant, a famous ski area and I noticed there - in parts - the vastness and infinite size of the country. Also during our trip to the national parc "Parc national de la Maurice" with Aaron and Lea. I was impressed of the elemental force of the Montmorency waterfall. The trips to Chambly, Quebec-City and to the several highlights of Montreal were impressive.  
I took a trip on the St. Lawrence River, which is one of the largest rivers in North America and is up to 3 km wide in places. It is used a lot for hydroelectric power generation.
The AURA, a music- and lightshow in the Basilica Notre-Dame was very impressive. I liked very much the evenings at the port, for example la Fiesta Latina or my personal highlight: The circus "Cirque du Soleil". The show "Kurios" took the subject „Thomas Edison meets Jules Verne retro future". Costumes, décor and music were all adapted to the years 1850-1900 and invited you to dream.

I learned a lot about the living in Montreal from conversations at cafés and with taxi drivers. They have similar problems like we have, for example lack of housing or inflation. How does a canadien boy say? The world changes and the problems will be the same everywhere.  
Thoughtful and full of incredible impressions which will stay for a long time, I made my way home. So Lea and Aaron can continue their way in Canada.
