The second part of our stay in Montréal is also characterized by almost consistently hot weather.   
That's why we decided to get out of the city the Saturday 2 weeks ago and visit a national park. After all, it's been a while since our last visit to one of the green wellness oases (and you can really get addicted to them!).   
The park is called "La Mauricie" and is located about 30 minutes above Trois-Riviéres (which in turn is between Montréal and Québec City).   
Unfortunately, it had rained so heavily the day before (a heavy summer downpour which also flooded some streets in Montréal) that all hiking trails within the park were closed.
Unfortunately, made things complicated, as we had driven to the park especially for this reason.   
So we quickly changed our plans and fulfilled another little Canada dream: we rented a canoe and took it out on Lake Wapizagonke.

The following Sunday also greeted us with sunshine and we visited the botanical gardens in Montréal.    
With its various themed gardens, this is a sensation in itself.    
There is a Chinese and Japanese garden, as well as many other themed spaces (vegetables, tree species and shade garden).   
There is also a natural garden of indigenous people. This was probably the most exciting garden for us, where we also learned a lot again about the indigenous connection to the world around.    
Next door in the Olympic Park, the Olympic flame was still burning (on the last day of the games in Paris).

Later in the week, we visited St. Joseph Oratory, the Atwater and Bonsecours markets.   
We were also lucky that the Streetfood Festival was taking place at the harbor this weekend.    
Streetfood festival here really means festival. In Germany, it's usually a street with 10-15 food trucks. Here, it's a whole square at the harbor with definitely 30 different trailer, trucks or booths. Food from many different countries (including Colombia, Korea, Iran, Jamaica, Japan and many more) and live music are available. A true festival for lovers of different foods.   
We also tried our way through and ate Colombian, Korean and Persian.

We spent our last full day in Montréal with a hearty breakfast (from our favorite store Le Beau Marché) and a stroll through the Rue Ste-Catherine in Westmount.    
This was followed by a walk to the town hall, which we hadn't visited before, and in the evening it was time to pack for our onward journey.   
Our last culinary excursion took us two streets away for dinner at a Japanese restaurant. We had Ramen (Japanese noodle soup).

Now it's off to Toronto for a week in the camper. From there we fly to Winnipeg and then drive on towards Calgary after 2-3 days.

In Montréal, we will definitely miss the great harbour, the culinary diversity, the great weekend program and the delicious croissants.   
We also hope that the good weather will stay with us for the next two weeks.   

Au revoir, Montréal!
