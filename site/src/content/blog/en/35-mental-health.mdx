I would like to share with you precious experiences, which I was able to learn and experience in a workshop about the mental health of indigenous people at the McGill University Montréal.

In Canada there live 5% Indigenous People, who belongs to the First Nations, Inuit or Métis. Over 50% of the Indigenous People live in urban areas, the other half lives in reservations predominantly in the northern states of Canada (Nunavut, northern Québéc, Labrador, Northwest Territories, Yukon, British Columbia).  
It was a pleasure to learn a lot more about their culture. They appreciate the mother Earth and are thankful for their ascendents. They do not take resources such as animals, plants, and water for granted. They live with the nature and in a community, which is very important for them. The traditional knowledge, which is transferred by the Elders, the language, to be and live on the land, the traditional food, the community, the ceremonies, relationships, and the recovery of the colonial traumata belong to the health determinants.

In my course, I was able to learn from different professors (from the fields of social and transcultural psychiatry and anthropology) as well as from the course participants from different countries of origin with a wide variety of backgrounds.

Unfortunately, I also experienced the dark side of the Canadian history. Therefore, I thought again about the German history. Settler from Europe, predominantly the British and the French (but also other European countries) came to Canada in 1608 to settle down. First, the French started trading with the Indigenous People in Québéc. But little by little, they were oppressed, and more and more land was taken away from them. In the 1960s, many children were abducted from the reservations to be taught in so-called Residentinal Schools and to adopt white culture (for civilization). They weren’t allowed to talk in their maternal language, they received new English or French names and they were sexual, physically and psychologically abused. They lost their culture, family, home, language, roots and traditions. Many children couldn’t leave the school anymore. At the same time, many indigenous children were abducted from their families and adopted by European families in Canada (the settlers).

The teachers, professors, medicines, researcher and therapists, who guided the class, carry this story with them (partly experienced by themselves or their parents). Traumata are passed on over generations and you can imagine, which psychological consequences this story have for the indigenous people till today. Not only the experience of the traumata, but the continuing systematic discrimination, oppression and impairment of them lead to massive psychological symptoms that make life very difficult. It develops a vicious circle. Till today they were impaired by the health system. They receive later a treatment in comparison to the others, therefore it is often to late (and this happens till today).  
I was able to participate at a ceremony, which I appreciate as a gift. I’m very thankful, that I could make this experience. Indigenous ceremonies shall increase the relationships and spirituality, give healing, memory and thankfulness.  
This training course was one of the most valuable experiences I have had in my professional training to date.
