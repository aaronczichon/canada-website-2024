We now have a “real” vacation. And we are using this opportunity to continue our journey to the west.  
A few weeks ago, we found a relocation offer where we can bring a camper from Montréal to Toronto and get it for quite a reasonable price.

However, when we picked up the camper in Montréal, we didn't expect to get such a large vehicle.  
Sure, we knew that Canadians love big RVs. But the fact that we were getting a vehicle like this for our trip to Toronto was a bit of a surprise.  
At almost 10 meters long, the vehicle is practically a truck (and would probably cause problems in Germany with our normal car driver's license).

For this 6-day trip, we opted for a route along the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario.  
Our first stop was a campground in St. Polycarpe.  
The first overnight stay was primarily to familiarize ourselves with the features and functions of our camper. And there were quite a few!  
For example, we were able to extend the two “slide-outs” and thus had a kind of apartment on wheels with 2 sofas, an alcove with benches and table, stove, sink, bathroom (with shower) and a bedroom.  
In Munich, you would probably pay €1200 cold for that.  
The campsite was great and we were even able to use the pool in the evening and enjoy our snack outside.

After a comfortable night in our rolling bedroom, we first headed to Coteau-Du-Lac the next day. There we visited a historic canal.  
We then continued on to Cornwall and the weather changed to slightly colder temperatures and rain.  
However, Cornwall itself impressed us with a great route along the St. Lawrence.

After Cornwall, we drove to the Woodland Islands. These are part of the Thousand Islands (a national park on the St. Lawrence River).  
We spent the night there at the Woodland Campground, which is a state-run campsite. Camping on an island in the river. Sounds like a dream, but it really was!

We received 2 free tickets for the “Upper Canada Village” open-air museum with our overnight stay.  
We thought long and hard about whether we should go there, but then decided to go. The idea was to stay there for 1-1.5 hours and then drive on.  
In the end, however, we spent over 3 hours in the museum.  
It was so interesting and well designed. There is a great program for all visitors and the different houses are so authentically designed that you feel like you've traveled back in time. Here are a few examples:  
There were bakers in the bakery who baked bread and cookies just like in the old days. There was a blacksmith who made nails and horseshoes according to old traditions. An old water-powered sawmill was cutting wood and even a hut, which represented an old schoolroom, was so authentic that children were “learning” there.  
We were so impressed by the visit there that we can only warmly recommend it to everyone.  
As we continued our journey, we made a stop in Prescott. There we visited our first fort (which, along with Quebec City and Fort Henry, was one of the most important along the St. Lawrence for defense against the Americans). However, the fort is also the smallest of the 3 and could be visited quickly.  
This time we spent the night at a campsite called “Ivy Lea”. The weather slowly improved and it stopped raining.

The next day, we finally made our way to Kingston and our first port of call was, of course, Fort Henry.  
Here we took part in a guided tour and learned more about the time of the war and the tense situation between America and Canada in the 19th century.  
We also visited Kingston itself and got a bit of a European feeling again, as the old town strongly resembles a small British town.

We probably had the best sunset at East Lake on a campsite owned by a former farmer.  
The next day, the weather was so good again that we were finally able to plan some hikes. To do this, we drove further along our route and stopped at Presqu'ile Provincial Park.  
The view over Lake Ontario here was wonderful.  
We then spent the night a little further west in Darlington Provincial Park.  
Here we got ourselves some firewood and ended the evening around the campfire.

The last stage then took us to the Greater Toronto Area. After a night at a campsite outside Missauga, we returned the camper on Saturday morning and drove into the city (Toronto) for dinner.  
After so many quiet and relaxing days, we didn't last too long in the big, crowded and noisy city and preferred to prepare for the next day. Because now it was time to fly to Winnipeg!

Our experiences in Winnipeg and Saskatchewan will follow in a new post.
