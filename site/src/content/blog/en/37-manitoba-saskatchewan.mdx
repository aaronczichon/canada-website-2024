Things happened between 25th of August and 1st of September.

A little late, we are back with the second half of our vacation.  
After arriving in Winnipeg, we first needed a few relaxing days.  
Winnipeg is the capital of the province of Manitoba and has a population of around 750,000. The centrepiece and probably the most famous place in Winnipeg is the “Forks”. This is the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  
Compared to Toronto or Montréal, Winnipeg is much quieter and less busy. However, we personally liked the city much better because it has so much to offer.  
There is the great Canadian Human Rights Museum, the Forks Market and Union Station.  
Unfortunately, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are always somewhat forgotten and we can only recommend everyone to include these two provinces on their list.

After 3 nights in Winnipeg, we drove on and started our journey towards Calgary.  
The next stop on the route was Hagraves, where we stayed for one night.  
Here, on the border to Saskatchewan, we are always impressed by the endless expanses of prairie.  
A not inconsiderable proportion of the grain in Germany comes from Canada as well as the Ukraine.

The next day we visited Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan.  
There is even less going on in Regina than in Winnipeg. Perhaps this was because we were only there for one day, but it felt a bit more “forgotten” here.  
The city doesn't have much to offer in terms of special features either, with the exception of a beautiful park and a few government buildings.  
So we quickly drove on to our next accommodation (and on through the Saskatchewan prairie) in a former church.  
Due to the drought this year, there were crickets all over the place. In fact, they were so intrusive that we had one in our car the following day.

Where we really liked it was Saskatoon. This slightly more northerly city is located on the Saskatchewan River and offers a great promenade, beautiful residential areas and great stores. It's so beautiful that we've already thought about spending the last leg of our year in Canada here. We'll see.  
We were also lucky enough to have a big fireworks display that weekend. Of course, that added an extra highlight to the whole thing.  
We will definitely come back here again. If only because we didn't have time to visit Prince Albert National Park.

Before we arrived in Calgary on Sunday, we spent another night from Saturday to Sunday in a small cabin on a farm.  
In the middle of the prairie, without electricity or running water, we were able to end our vacation with wonderful weather and a view over the endless fields.  
We even had a barbecue, which will probably be the last time this year.

But we are now also glad that we have arrived in Calgary. The frequent packing and unpacking of the last few weeks was a bit exhausting and it's good to have an apartment for the next 3 months.
