After our exciting vacation from Montréal to Toronto and then from Winnipeg via Regina and Saskatoon, we have now been in Calgary since September 1st. Our home for the next 3 months.

As nice as a vacation is, everyday life returns just as quickly and we have to adapt to the new local conditions.  
Even though we are now very good at adapting our accommodation to our needs after more than half a year, it is still a bit of a surprise every time.  
Our apartment in Calgary is located just outside the city, in the area of Raddison Heights to be precise.  
Probably the biggest challenge we currently have to overcome is the additional change in time zone.  
So far, this hasn't been a major problem in the east or even in Montréal.  
Hier jedoch haben wir nun eine Zeit von UTC-6 was einer Verschiebung zur deutschen Zeit von -8h bedeutet. Da muss man dann in den Zeiten, wann man aufstehen muss, doch etwas flexibel sein.

Calgary welcomed us with great weather and temperatures of up to 30 degrees in the first two weeks. And even though it's a bit colder now, the sun doesn't want to say goodbye quite yet.  
My mom and dad arrived on September 5. We used the great time we had together for a trip to Dinosaur Provincial Park.  
It was perhaps not the wisest decision to visit this park at 29 degrees and without any possibility of shade, but it was still a wonderful trip.  
Here, too, we were able to discover a completely different landscape, the likes of which we have never seen in Canada before.  
The country, indeed every province, always has new natural surprises in store.  
The Sunday after the trip, my birthday, we celebrated with a trip to the downhill kart track, a visit to the Farmers Market and a great dinner.

The following week, also on Sunday, we spontaneously registered for a beach volleyball tournament, which took place just 2 km away from us.  
As the team with the longest journey, we tried to represent the SSV Hermaringen beach volleyball team, the Baller-Bears, at our best.  
It was great fun and very well organized. However, as we hadn't played any volleyball since February (and no beach volleyball at all this year), we were unfortunately unable to win any of our matches. It didn't help that all our opponents were professional beach volleyball players.

Our next excursions are already planned! On Saturday we are going to the Calgary Zoo and on Sunday we are driving towards the Rocky Mountains so that we can go hiking in the Spray Valley or Bow Valley Provincial Park. Let's hope there's no snow there yet.
