Last Saturday we visited the Calgary Zoo.

The weather was perfect on Saturday. It wasn't too hot and it wasn't raining either. So we went to the Calgary Zoo in the morning after breakfast.  
The zoo is divided into themed areas. There is Canada/North America, Africa, Asia and a prehistoric section. Animals from the respective regions can be found in each section.  
There were penguins, monkeys, polar bears, hippos, giraffes, red pandas and much more!

Personally, I haven't been to a zoo for a few years, so I had all the fun. I particularly liked the penguin house. Not only because they are my favourite animals, but also because you can get within a few centimetres of the animals and thus observe them up close.

Calgary tries to keep the animals here at the zoo as species-appropriate as possible and provide appropriate enclosures.  
A lot of educational material and knowledge about the respective animals is also provided (e.g. a classification of the degree of endangerment is shown for each animal).  
Of course, it is still a zoo with all its advantages and disadvantages.  
However, you can tell that they are making an effort to take care of the animals.  
For example, a grizzly bear was brought into the zoo, which would otherwise have been released for shooting. A few years ago, this bear had developed a close relationship with humans and their food sources (garbage cans, etc.) and therefore posed a danger in human-bear contact.  
Calgary then brought this bear into the zoo.

An absolute highlight followed on Sunday.  
We had planned to visit Spray Valley Provincial Park.  
We've learned something important over the last few months: provincial parks are at least as beautiful as national parks with the advantage that there is usually not as much crowded.  
The Spray Valley belongs to Kananaskins County and is located below Canmore and the Bow Valley Provincial Park in the Rocky Mountains.

Our destination was the Tent Ridge Horseshoe, which is a mountain range in the shape of a horseshoe.  
Starting at 1876m, we hiked a short distance through the forest and then quickly climbed the first mountain.  
The most difficult section with small, short climbing passages was right here at the start.  
Once at the top, however, you could already guess what the rest of the route had in store for you. You had a wonderful view in all directions.  
To the north of the Spray Valley Reservoir, to the northeast and east of the mountain range of Mount Engadine, The Tower and Mount Galatea and to the southwest of Mount Smuts and Mount Stark.

We then climbed a little further up the mountain range to the weather station. From there, the last small ascent to the summit of Mount Tent Ridge at an altitude of 2524 meters.

The great thing about this hike was that you spent little time in the forest and had a windy but wonderful view in all directions of the Rocky Mountains on the mountain range itself the whole time.

However, so that you can participate even more, we have put together another video for you.
