Stefan and I (Silke) visited Canada from September 5 to 26. We had been looking forward to getting to know this country for a very long time, after Aaron and Lea had already made it tasty for us so often.

Aaron picked us up from the airport and also helped us with our rental car, which was quite good as our English skills are not the best. Unfortunately, there was a slight disappointment as this rental car was far too small for our large luggage, so it was a little difficult to fit everything in.

Our son then led us to his and Lea's home, who was already waiting for us with coffee and cake. It was a very warm welcome. We then spent the first three nights with them in Calgary.

Calgary also welcomed us with its best weather at this time of year, we had days of over 30 degrees. The first thing we did alone in this foreign country (Aaron and Lea had to work during the day) was to visit the oldest zoo in North America. It was really impressive as it is divided into different continents. Afterwards we strolled through the city on our own and in the evening we met the two of them and went out for dinner together.

On Saturday, the four of us went on an excursion to Dinosaur Provincial Park. It felt like we were on another planet. Wasteland, lunar landscape, but beautiful. You could have come across rattlesnakes here, but thank goodness they didn't make themselves visible to us.

On Sunday, we celebrated Aaron's birthday in this big city with a visit to Baker Park and then karting at Win Sport Canada Olympia Park, which was so much fun for us old people that we went three times. In the evening, our son chose a restaurant where we invited the two of them for a birthday dinner.

The next day, we set off on our own through the Rocky Mountains and national parks. This landscape is simply unbelievably beautiful with lakes and rivers, various forests and villages.

Our round trip started in Calgary and went via Canmore, Sicamous, Sorrento, Fauquier, Beasley, Warner and via Invermere back to Calgary. We had a wide variety of beautiful cabins, which we can only recommend. There was even a tree house in Warner.  
We stayed in each of these cabins for two nights, except for the last one in Invermere, where we stayed for three. We had no regrets as it felt like we were really on a ranch, which we were, but the feeling was palpable.

We did a few different trails at the places we stayed or visited national parks like Banff of course and the famous Lake Louise, which is incredible with its color. Speaking of lakes, every 5 km you pass a lake, small or large, as well as rivers. It seemed to us that there was no stretch of road where there was no water to be seen. One of the most beautiful parks we visited was Battle Bluff, also known as Puma Park, which of course was nowhere to be seen. It is located near Savona and the fact that it had different park bays meant that the hikers were well spread out and you could enjoy this incredible silence and landscape.

Silence was the big theme of our vacation here and it really impressed us. We have never experienced such indescribable silence so often in parks, on trails or in front of our cabin. Not a bird, a cricket or even a vehicle. Simply nothing to hear. Unbelievable.

But unfortunately, global warming is also making itself felt here. Lakes and rivers, some of which had dried up completely or partially, and miles of scorched forests on the mountains. We still saw some glowing earth, which made us very thoughtful.

We were both amazed by the vehicles that drove here in Canada, whether it was the fire engines, ambulances or, of course, the trucks and the mile-long freight trains. Especially as they looked from a distance like boas winding their way along the mountains.  
As the goods are mainly transported by rail, there were hardly any trucks to be seen on the roads compared to Germany. In general, the traffic was a dream. I, who doesn't like driving, enjoyed driving on the highways myself, as there were no traffic jams and no tailgaters. Maximum speeds were between 90 and 110 km/h. However, some of the traffic rules took some getting used to and thankfully Aaron and Lea pointed them out and explained them to us during the first few days.

The small towns we visited are more or less worth seeing. We liked Revelstoke, Nakusp, Nelson, Creston and Invermere.

To my regret, we didn't encounter any bears or moose, but we did get to see the Northern Lights for half an hour from our cabin in Fauquier. The very first we had ever seen. Beautiful.

The people we met were all very helpful and extremely friendly. As soon as someone realized that we weren't coping with a situation or didn't know where to go, someone spoke to us and helped us.

Canada showed us its best side, we had absolutely fantastic weather and were even able to swim in a lake in the middle of September.

At the end of our trip, we stayed overnight with Aaron and Lea before flying back home, and it wasn't easy to say goodbye. But it was good to see how happy they are in Canada.
