Or welcome back to the Rocky Mountains.   

After Silke and Stefan left last week on Thursday, Philipp and Corinna came to visit us.   
Together we went to the Rocky Mountains from Friday to Sunday. More precisely, Canmore and Banff and their surroundings.   
We drove to Canmore on Friday and showed them the small town. We already know it from our vacation in 2022.    
After visiting the town, we walked the small Grotto Mountain Horseshoe Loop. This offered a great view of the valley in which Canmore is located and the surrounding mountains (e.g. the mountain chain of the "Three Sisters").

The next day, like the weekend before last, we drove to Spray Valley Provincial Park. There we had planned a slightly longer hiking route with the two of them.   
We hiked 410 meters up the Little Lougheed. There, with our photographic support, Philipp proposed to Corinna. She said "yes".   
We then celebrated their engagement at a dinner in Canmore.

On Sunday, we did our own "Hop On - Hop Off" route. First we drove to Banff and then to the national park of the same name.   
We stopped at Johnson Lake, Lake Minniwanka and Two Jack Lake.   
All in all, we enjoyed the arrival of autumn with its wonderful colors and were still lucky enough to have a few rays of sunshine to make the days beautiful.

Philipp and Corinna are now moving on through the Rocky Mountains to Vancouver and Vancouver Island. But they will certainly tell you all about it in a guest post.

We have been on "vacation" since yesterday and flew to Whitehorse. More on this in the coming days...
