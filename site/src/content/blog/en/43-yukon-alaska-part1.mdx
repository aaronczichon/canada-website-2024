The Yukon/Alaska vacation is divided into several blog posts. This is part 1 from Whitehorse, Yukon to Haines, Alaska.

Vacation, finally! The 2nd one this year.    
This time we've thought of something special. We're flying from Calgary to Whitehorse and then driving via Kluane National Park & Haines Junction to Alaska. More precisely, to Haines and Skagway. From there back to Canada, to Carcross and back to Whitehorse.   
This road trip is also known as "The Golden Circle". It is named after the gold rush that began in Skagway over 120 years ago.   

When we arrived in Whitehorse, we were lucky and got a free upgrade to a pickup truck from our rental car company. We gladly accepted.   
After a short trip to the city center to get a Yukon flag and groceries, we drove to our first accommodation.   
This is located between Whitehorse and Hains Junction in Mendenhall Landing on the Alaska Highway.

On day 2, we set off early in the morning in the direction of Haines Junction and Kluane National Park.   
Our destination was the King's Throne Trail. Unfortunately, we didn't make it to the top as there was already quite a bit of snow there. Nevertheless, we were able to enjoy a wonderful view of the St. Elias mountain range and the valley below. However, gloves and hats have become obligatory companions on our hikes up here.   
As we couldn't complete the King's Throne Trail, we drove to the Elias Lake Trail and then walked it. Here we were able to enjoy wonderful landscapes and views.   
Both trails are located below Haines Junction and therefore towards the border with Haines, Alaska.

As we wanted to spend as much time as possible in the national park, we drove back to Kluane the following day.   
This time we headed north from Haines Junction.   
The Sheep Creek Trail first led through the forest and then uphill on a sandy surface. At the top, we had a view of two valleys and a glacier in the distance.    
On the way back, we took a look at two smaller trails (Spruce Beetle & Soldiers Summit). We also saw a bear and several deer. In addition to the countless Dall Sheep.

Then we continued on to our next accommodation: Haines in Alaska.   
As we naturally had to drive through Haines Junction and along Kluane National Park again, we interrupted our journey to take a look at the Auriol Trail below the mountains.    
The onward journey towards Haines first takes us into the Canadian province of British Columbia. There the Haines Highway went up to 1007m. Of course there is already snow up there.

Unfortunately, we had a problem when we arrived at the border. The border official told us that since the end of 2022, you can only enter the USA with a valid ESTA. Which we didn't have (during our visit to Seattle in spring 2022, we were still able to enter without one).   
We then turned around at the border and politely asked the Canadian border official if we could use their WiFi to apply for the ESTA. He supported us, of course, and we submitted the ESTA application. Unfortunately, it can take up to 72 hours for this to be approved.   
We then drove back to the US border and were kindly allowed to wait at the border post to see if our ESTA would be approved in the next 1-2 hours. If this had not been the case, we would have had to drive back over the pass to Haines Junction (snow, darkness and a 3-4 hour drive was not something we really wanted to take on again).   
Luckily for us, the ESTA was approved about 1.5 hours later and after about 2 hours at the border post we were finally allowed to enter the USA and continue our journey to our next accommodation in Haines.

**Canada üá®üá¶ Facts ‚úîÔ∏è**     
Today: Kluane National Park Edition   
Lea has collected some facts and interesting things about Kluane National Park. 

- Kluane National Park includes the Elias Mountains range with the highest mountain in Canada, Mount Logan at 5,959m. The park is a UNESCO Heritage Site.    
- It offers some very beautiful hiking trails on the front mountains and in the valleys.   
- We found the hike at Kluane Lake (Sheep Creek Trail) very beautiful, we could see the Kaskawulsh Glacier and the Slims River from above.   
- In Kluane National Park, hikers are warned that there are bears in the area. In the past, the indigenous people used to sing while picking berries to signal to the bears that they were in the area and so that the bears would not be surprised. Normally bears are shy, but they can go into defense mode if they are surprised. It is therefore recommended to sing and speak loudly if you are spotted by a bear.    
- The Alaska Highway was built in 1942 due to the Second World War (for the transportation of soldiers). The highway was then opened to everyone in 1948, although it took three times as long to get from A to B at that time. Construction was not easy for the American soldiers. A third of the soldiers were African-American and had no experience of -30 degrees in winter.    
Life in the national park and in Yukon changed drastically with the construction of the highway. Many Native Americans settled along the highway and were able to visit their relatives who lived further away more frequently. Unfortunately, this also had negative consequences for the indigenous people. Many settlers from Europe brought diseases with them, which the indigenous people contracted and died from. The indigenous people were quickly deprived of their rights and prohibited from fishing and hunting, which was their livelihood. And the highway was used to transport indigenous children to residential schools in the 1960s.    
- Today, the Canadian government and the Kluane First Nation, Champagne and Aishihik First Nations are working together to preserve Kluane National Park.
