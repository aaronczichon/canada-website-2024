> This is part 2 of our Yukon-Alaska vacation. Part 1, with the journey from Whitehorse to Haines, can be found [here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/en/blog/en/43-yukon-alaska-part1).

After the tense border crossing, we were glad to have arrived in Haines.  
Alsaka welcomed us with not so good weather (which continued the nearly whole time we were here). But we didn't let that stop us.

After all the hiking in Kluane National Park, we needed something relaxing time. We went for breakfast in Haines and had a look around the small town and its surroundings. In the evening, we ventured back near towards the border and had dinner at the 33 Mile Roadhouse (Lea was absolutely thrilled with their salmon burger).

The following day, we wanted to walk the Ayiklutu Trail. However, we also had to abandon this hike as the last section was very muddy and flooded due to the rain of the last few days. Once again, we had a view of a glacier in the mountains.  
After an afternoon stop at the caf√©, we visited the section between Chilkoot Lake and Lutak Inlet again. Despite many fishermen for the high salmon population, we couldn't see any bears.  
At this time of year, many Canadians from Yukon come here to Alaska to fish for salmon. Therefore, relatively speaking, there was a lot going on in Haines.

On Wednesday, October 9, we wanted to take the ferry to Skagway.  
As the ferry wasn't due to depart until 12:30, we had a coffee in Haines after breakfast and then made our way to the terminal.  
The ferry arrived at the terminal on time, but was unable to depart due to technical problems. This delayed our journey by 3 hours. We had actually planned to visit Skagway that afternoon. Unfortunately, this was no longer possible. In the end, we only had time for a little shopping and dinner at the Red Onion Saloon.

As the weather in Skagway only had rain to offer, we only did a short hike to Lower Dewey Lake and Icy Lake the next day.  
Afterwards, we took a closer look at the small town.  
Skagway is very touristy. Primarily for cruise ships. During a chat with a few locals, we learned that up to 4 cruise ships dock here every day in summer and that 10,000 people can easily invade the small village of around 600 inhabitants.  
However, as winter is now approaching, most of the stores are already closed. Many of the owners don't even live in Skagway during the winter, but either in the south in the USA or in Haines. Some also live in Whitehorse.  
The locals tended to regard us as exotic people who were vacationing there at this time of year and had **not** come to the city on a cruise ship.  
You can feel the tourist character of the city everywhere. From all kinds of souvenir stores (sometimes more, sometimes less beautiful) to bus tours, there is everything possible here in summer. Unfortunately, the prices here are also correspondingly high in the restaurants and we are already looking forward to being back in Canada soon.

Alaska, Skagway to be precise, bids us farewell with dry weather. Finally, we walked to Smuggler's Cove via Yakutania Point.  
We grabbed a coffee in the town before we left. We got talking to the owner there. He then recommended that we go to Dyea (just outside Skagway in the bay).  
And it was worth it. We saw the old site of the first village where the Klondike Gold Rush began.  
And we were lucky enough to see a black bear.

But then we were really heading back towards Canada. Our route took us back over the border via the White Pass at an altitude of just over 1000m. Of course, there was snow again at the top of the pass.  
The border control on the Canadian side was, in contrast to our entry into the USA, unspectacular and we were back in Canada after 2 minutes.

How our journey continues in Yukon, you can read in part 3 later. Until then, stay tuned! üá®üá¶üèîÔ∏èüá∫üá∏

Lea has collected some facts and interesting things about Haines, Skagway and surroundings.

Facts about Haines, Alaska:    
- In the Tling√≠t language, Haines is called ‚ÄúDeish√∫‚Äù (‚ÄúEnd of the Trail‚Äù). 
- Haines has a very long indigenous history and administration, was the first army base in Alaska and was the starting point of the Klondike Gold Rush.    
- From the Canadian border, take the Haines Highway along the Chilkat River, home to the world's largest bald eagle population. Every November, up to 3,500 bald eagles can be seen in the Chilkat Valley.   
- On the Chilkat River lies the village of Klukwan (Tl√°kw.aan) - ‚Äúthe Elternal Village‚Äù - a village of the First Nations (the Jilk√°at Kw√°an tribe). They speak the Ling√≠t language. There are many different tribes within the Ling√≠t First Nations. They share stories, art, songs and nature. Living with the plants, the animals, social justice, reciprocity and respect for the land are their most important values. They want to pass on their knowledge and resources to future generations. Some of the tribes are named after animals (Eagle tribe, Raven tribe). The high salmon density and the warm springs prevent the river from freezing over and thus also provide a good area for bald eagles.   
- The Tling√≠ts settled in the valley between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago. The first settlers arrived in 1881.   
- A few words in Ling√≠t: Gunalch√©esh! (Thank you!), Koot√©eyaa (totem pole), Daak (inland, into the forest, up toward the mountains), √âek (shoreward, down toward the ocean), Y√©il (raven), Ch'√°ak (eagle), S'eek (black bear), X√≥ots (brown bear).   
- The river between Lake Chilkoot and Lutak Bay is home to many bears, especially in the summer months. The bears come to feed on their winter food because of the high salmon population. Many anglers can also be seen there. There are a total of 5 different species of salmon there throughout the year.

Facts about Skagway, Alaska:    
- In the Tling√≠t language, Skagway is called ‚ÄúSkaqua or Shgagw√©i‚Äù (‚ÄúWhite caps on the water‚Äù).   
- Historically, the small town is known for the great Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, and you can still ride the White Pass and Yukon Railroad by train today. The train line was built for the gold rush and runs up the White Pass to Whitehorse (Yukon).   
- The small town with a population of around 1,060 is very touristy, with 3-4 cruise ships a day in summer and now only 2-3 times a week in the fall. A saleswoman in a souvenir store told us that she lives in Haines in winter. Skagway seems to be ‚Äúextinct‚Äù from October to May.   
- Deiy√°a (Dyea - ‚Äúto pack‚Äù) was built by the Tlingit natives long before the Klondike Gold Rush. The village is located about 16 km (two bays) from Skagway and served as an access point to the interior of Alaska and Yukon. It was also used as a transportation corridor between the villages of Tl√°kw Aan (Klukwan, near Haines) and Dyea. Travel by canoe (yaakw - canoe) was necessary as there was no overland route. The various aboriginal tribes traded fish, plant material (for medicine), mussels, goats, sheep, moose, etc. among themselves.    
- During the gold rush of 1897-1898, the Tlingit village became a busy town. It was used as a transportation corridor for the Chilkoot Pass, which led to the gold mines in Yukon. Many ships arrived from the USA (e.g. Seattle or St. Francisco) and the population grew to 30,000 people. Hotels, stores and houses were built. Prices were driven ever higher.    
- Dyea only existed for 1.5 years and a ‚Äúghost town‚Äù was left behind or nature has since returned. In Skagway at the harbor, the water was deeper (ideal for large ships) and the White Pass and Yukon Railroad (train line) was built there. It was therefore easier to go up the White Pass to the gold mines via Skagway. Before the train line, people had to travel about 2600 miles for 33 miles. They had to walk the route several times to bring their luggage up the pass. Canada required the men to carry a year's worth of provisions and food to continue on to Yukon to the gold mines.
