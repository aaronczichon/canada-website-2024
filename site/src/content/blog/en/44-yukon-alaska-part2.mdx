> This is part 2 of our Yukon-Alaska vacation. Part 1, with the journey from Whitehorse to Haines, can be found [here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/en/blog/en/43-yukon-alaska-part1).

After the tense border crossing, we were glad to have arrived in Haines.  
Alsaka welcomed us with not so good weather (which continued the nearly whole time we were here). But we didn't let that stop us.

After all the hiking in Kluane National Park, we needed something relaxing time. We went for breakfast in Haines and had a look around the small town and its surroundings. In the evening, we ventured back near towards the border and had dinner at the 33 Mile Roadhouse (Lea was absolutely thrilled with their salmon burger).

The following day, we wanted to walk the Ayiklutu Trail. However, we also had to abandon this hike as the last section was very muddy and flooded due to the rain of the last few days. Once again, we had a view of a glacier in the mountains.  
After an afternoon stop at the café, we visited the section between Chilkoot Lake and Lutak Inlet again. Despite many fishermen for the high salmon population, we couldn't see any bears.  
At this time of year, many Canadians from Yukon come here to Alaska to fish for salmon. Therefore, relatively speaking, there was a lot going on in Haines.

On Wednesday, October 9, we wanted to take the ferry to Skagway.  
As the ferry wasn't due to depart until 12:30, we had a coffee in Haines after breakfast and then made our way to the terminal.  
The ferry arrived at the terminal on time, but was unable to depart due to technical problems. This delayed our journey by 3 hours. We had actually planned to visit Skagway that afternoon. Unfortunately, this was no longer possible. In the end, we only had time for a little shopping and dinner at the Red Onion Saloon.

As the weather in Skagway only had rain to offer, we only did a short hike to Lower Dewey Lake and Icy Lake the next day.  
Afterwards, we took a closer look at the small town.  
Skagway is very touristy. Primarily for cruise ships. During a chat with a few locals, we learned that up to 4 cruise ships dock here every day in summer and that 10,000 people can easily invade the small village of around 600 inhabitants.  
However, as winter is now approaching, most of the stores are already closed. Many of the owners don't even live in Skagway during the winter, but either in the south in the USA or in Haines. Some also live in Whitehorse.  
The locals tended to regard us as exotic people who were vacationing there at this time of year and had **not** come to the city on a cruise ship.  
You can feel the tourist character of the city everywhere. From all kinds of souvenir stores (sometimes more, sometimes less beautiful) to bus tours, there is everything possible here in summer. Unfortunately, the prices here are also correspondingly high in the restaurants and we are already looking forward to being back in Canada soon.

Alaska, Skagway to be precise, bids us farewell with dry weather. Finally, we walked to Smuggler's Cove via Yakutania Point.  
We grabbed a coffee in the town before we left. We got talking to the owner there. He then recommended that we go to Dyea (just outside Skagway in the bay).  
And it was worth it. We saw the old site of the first village where the Klondike Gold Rush began.  
And we were lucky enough to see a black bear.

But then we were really heading back towards Canada. Our route took us back over the border via the White Pass at an altitude of just over 1000m. Of course, there was snow again at the top of the pass.  
The border control on the Canadian side was, in contrast to our entry into the USA, unspectacular and we were back in Canada after 2 minutes.
