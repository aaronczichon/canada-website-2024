> This is part 3 of our Yukon-Alaska vacation. You can find part 1, with the journey from Whitehorse to Haines, [here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/blog/43-yukon-alaska-part1/) and [part 2 here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/blog/44-yukon-alaska-part2/).

When we arrived back in Canada, our first accommodation was not far from Carcross. The modern A-Frame Cabin is located just outside the town and therefore completely surrounded by nature.

The next day, the weather was similar to the last few days. It rained most of the time.   
However, we still wanted to do at least a bit of hiking and drove back a little way along the Klondike Highway towards Skagway to the Sam McGee Trail.    
The trail offered us a great view and we were able to hike in fresh snow for the first time. The weather also improved considerably at the top of the mountain and the light rain turned into snowfall.   
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Carcross and discovered a nice little coffee house which we enjoyed.

The weather improved the following day and we visited the smallest desert in the world: Carcross Dessert.    
We also took a look at Tagish, which is cut off from civilization, and then spent the afternoon in Carcross.   
We also changed cabins from Carcross to Annie Lake. This is a real yuko cabin without electricity, running water and of course an outhouse.

Yukon and its many lakes are a great experience whatever the weather. This also applies to the sun and Marsh Lake, which stretches from Tagish almost as far as Whitehorse.    
The adjoining trail in the small village of the same name, Marsh Lake (Shea's Trail), offers a view of the lake after a few meters through the forest.

From Annie Lake we continued on to our last stop, Whitehorse.   
There, in sunny (but cold) weather, we visited Miles Canyon, which has formed around the Yukon River. Nearby there is a forest area with some beautiful hiking trails.

Our last cabin in Whitehorse even had a sauna, which we gladly used the following day.    
The following day, we set ourselves a trail on Gray Mountain. After the last few days and all the hiking, we limited ourselves to a short loop.   
Instead, we drove to the Wildlife Preserve in the afternoon and had a look at the animals there. The Preserve is home to some of the animals found in the Yukon in large areas which also offer plenty of space to run around.

It had started to snow overnight and so we were able to enjoy one last wintry day. The whole of Whitehorse was covered in snow. So we explored the town in the snow flurries and enjoyed our last day before leaving.

After spending the last night before our return flight in a hotel at the airport, we were able to walk across the road to the small airport early in the morning and start our journey home to Calgary.

Yukon and Alaska are definitely worth a trip. If you were to ask us what we liked best in Canada so far, Newfoundland and Yukon would be together on first place.
