> This is part 3 of our Yukon-Alaska vacation. You can find part 1, with the journey from Whitehorse to Haines, [here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/blog/43-yukon-alaska-part1/) and [part 2 here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/blog/44-yukon-alaska-part2/).

When we arrived back in Canada, our first accommodation was not far from Carcross. The modern A-Frame Cabin is located just outside the town and therefore completely surrounded by nature.

The next day, the weather was similar to the last few days. It rained most of the time.   
However, we still wanted to do at least a bit of hiking and drove back a little way along the Klondike Highway towards Skagway to the Sam McGee Trail.    
The trail offered us a great view and we were able to hike in fresh snow for the first time. The weather also improved considerably at the top of the mountain and the light rain turned into snowfall.   
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Carcross and discovered a nice little coffee house which we enjoyed.

The weather improved the following day and we visited the smallest desert in the world: Carcross Dessert.    
We also took a look at Tagish, which is cut off from civilization, and then spent the afternoon in Carcross.   
We also changed cabins from Carcross to Annie Lake. This is a real yukon cabin without electricity, running water and of course an outhouse.

Yukon and its many lakes are a great experience whatever the weather.    
The small trail at the Marsh Lake (Shea's Trail), offers a view of the lake after a few meters through the forest.

From Annie Lake we continued on to our last stop, Whitehorse.   
There, in sunny (but cold) weather, we visited Miles Canyon, which has formed around the Yukon River. Nearby there is a forest area with some beautiful hiking trails.

Our last cabin in Whitehorse even had a sauna, which we gladly used the following day.    
The following day, we set ourselves a trail on Gray Mountain. After the last few days and all the hiking, we limited ourselves to a short loop.   
Instead, we drove to the Wildlife Preserve in the afternoon and had a look at the animals there. The Preserve is home to some of the animals found in the Yukon.

It had started to snow overnight and so we were able to enjoy one last wintry day. The whole of Whitehorse was covered in snow. So we explored the town in the snow flurries and enjoyed our last day before leaving.

After spending the last night before our return flight in a hotel at the airport, we were able to walk across the road to the small airport early in the morning and start our journey home to Calgary.

Yukon and Alaska are definitely worth a trip. If you were to ask us what we liked best in Canada so far, Newfoundland and Yukon would be together on first place.

Lea has collected some facts and interesting things about Yukon and surroundings.

Facts about Carcross, Yukon:   
- Carcross is the traditional territory of the Carcross Tagish First Nation. The name Carcross comes from ‚ÄúCaribou Crossing‚Äù (crossing the narrows between Bennett and Nares Lake). About 470 inhabitants live there. The Matthew Watson General Store here in Carcross is the oldest general store in the Yukon. We don't really know whether it has already closed or was just ‚Äúclosed for season‚Äù (closed due to the winter season). Carcross is home to the smallest desert in the world (Carcross desert).   
- In Carcross you can learn a lot about the art, culture and history of the Carcross Tagish First Nation. Six clans live here: Wolf, Raven, Killer Whale, Frog, Beaver and Woodworm. Their territory lies between Dyea (near Skagway) along the Chilkoot Trail to Whitehorse. There are several totem poles, small souvenir stores, an art museum and the Ancestor's house and Learning Center. The ancestor Skookum Jim Mason (or ‚ÄúKeish‚Äù in English) also shaped the Klondike Gold Rush. He commuted between Dyea, Carcross and Klondike and helped the gold seekers with packing and transportation.    
- Many of the houses in Carcross are almost 100 years old. The White Pass and Yukon Railroad runs through Carcross, from Skagway to Whitehorse. From Carcross, the prospectors continued by boat up the Yukon and Klondike Rivers to reach Dawson City.

Facts about Yukon in general:   
- The Yukon Territory got its name from the river of the same name. It runs through the northwest of America and is also the fifth largest river there. Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are territories and not provinces. All other federal states are provinces, which means that they are self-governing. The territories report directly to the Canadian federal government.    
- Yukon has the third lowest population density of all provinces and territories.    
- Yukon is 482,443 square kilometers in size and has 45,597 inhabitants. In comparison, Germany has an area of 357,600 square kilometers and approximately 83 million inhabitants. Approximately 9,500 inhabitants belong to the 14 First Nations.    
- Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon, has a population of around 36,201. The First Nations already lived there several thousand years ago. The population of Whitehorse rose sharply after the discovery of gold in Klondike (gold rush) in 1896. Winter days there are very short, while summer days can be up to 19 hours long. Because Whitehorse is located in a valley, the temperature there is mild compared to other places at the same latitude. In winter, however, temperatures can drop to -40 degrees.    
- Many attractions are already closed for the season at the beginning of October, so the summer season is very short.
