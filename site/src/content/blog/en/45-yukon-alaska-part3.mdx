> This is part 3 of our Yukon-Alaska vacation. You can find part 1, with the journey from Whitehorse to Haines, [here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/blog/43-yukon-alaska-part1/) and [part 2 here](https://canada.aaronczichon.de/blog/44-yukon-alaska-part2/).

When we arrived back in Canada, our first accommodation was not far from Carcross. The modern A-Frame Cabin is located just outside the town and therefore completely surrounded by nature.

The next day, the weather was similar to the last few days. It rained most of the time.   
However, we still wanted to do at least a bit of hiking and drove back a little way along the Klondike Highway towards Skagway to the Sam McGee Trail.    
The trail offered us a great view and we were able to hike in fresh snow for the first time. The weather also improved considerably at the top of the mountain and the light rain turned into snowfall.   
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Carcross and discovered a nice little coffee house which we enjoyed.

The weather improved the following day and we visited the smallest desert in the world: Carcross Dessert.    
We also took a look at Tagish, which is cut off from civilization, and then spent the afternoon in Carcross.   
We also changed cabins from Carcross to Annie Lake. This is a real yuko cabin without electricity, running water and of course an outhouse.

Yukon and its many lakes are a great experience whatever the weather. This also applies to the sun and Marsh Lake, which stretches from Tagish almost as far as Whitehorse.    
The adjoining trail in the small village of the same name, Marsh Lake (Shea's Trail), offers a view of the lake after a few meters through the forest.

From Annie Lake we continued on to our last stop, Whitehorse.   
There, in sunny (but cold) weather, we visited Miles Canyon, which has formed around the Yukon River. Nearby there is a forest area with some beautiful hiking trails.

Our last cabin in Whitehorse even had a sauna, which we gladly used the following day.    
The following day, we set ourselves a trail on Gray Mountain. After the last few days and all the hiking, we limited ourselves to a short loop.   
Instead, we drove to the Wildlife Preserve in the afternoon and had a look at the animals there. The Preserve is home to some of the animals found in the Yukon in large areas which also offer plenty of space to run around.

It had started to snow overnight and so we were able to enjoy one last wintry day. The whole of Whitehorse was covered in snow. So we explored the town in the snow flurries and enjoyed our last day before leaving.

After spending the last night before our return flight in a hotel at the airport, we were able to walk across the road to the small airport early in the morning and start our journey home to Calgary.

Yukon and Alaska are definitely worth a trip. If you were to ask us what we liked best in Canada so far, Newfoundland and Yukon would be together on first place.

Lea has collected some facts and interesting things about Yukon and surroundings.

Facts about Carcross, Yukon:   
-	Carcross ist das traditionelle Territorium der Carcross Tagish First Nation. Der Name Carcross stammt von ‚ÄûCaribou Crossing‚Äú (√úberquerung der Enge zwischen dem Bennett und Nares Lake). Es leben dort etwa 470 Einwohner*innen. Der Matthew Watson General Store hier in Carcross ist der √§lteste Gemischtwarenladen in Yukon. Wir wissen nicht so richtig, ob dieser bereits geschlossen hat oder aktuell nur ‚Äûclosed for season‚Äú (geschlossen aufgrund der Wintersaison) war. In Carcross gibt es die kleinste W√ºste der Welt (Carcross desert).   
-	In Carcross kann man viel √ºber die Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte der Carcross Tagish First Nation lernen. Sechs Clans leben hier: Wolf, Rabe, Killerwal, Frosch, Biber und Holzwurm. Ihr Territorium liegt zwischen Dyea (bei Skagway) entlang des Chilkoot Trail bis nach Whitehorse. Es gibt mehrere Totem Poles, kleine Souvenir-Shops, ein Kunstmuseum und das Vorfahren- und Lernhaus (Ancestor‚Äôs house and Learning Center). Der Vorfahre Skookum Jim Mason (oder in Englisch ‚ÄûKeish‚Äú) pr√§gte ebenfalls den Klondike Goldrausch. Er pendelte zwischen Dyea, Carcross und Klondike und half den Goldsuchern beim Packen und Transportieren.    
-	Viele H√§user in Carcross sind fast 100 Jahre alt. Der White Pass and Yukon Railroad (Zugstrecke) f√ºhrt durch Carcross durch von Skagway nach Whitehorse. Von Carcross aus sind die Goldsucher weiter mit dem Schiff den Yukon und Klondike River hinauf gefahren, um nach Dawson City zu gelangen. 

Facts about Yukon in general:   
- The Yukon Territory got its name from the river of the same name. Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are territories and not provinces. All other federal states are provinces, which means that they are self-governing. The territories report directly to the Canadian federal government.    
- Yukon has the third lowest population density of all provinces and territories, followed by Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.    
- Yukon is 482,443 square kilometers in size and has 45,597 inhabitants. In comparison, Germany has an area of 357,600 square kilometers and approximately 83 million inhabitants. Approximately 9,500 inhabitants belong to the 14 First Nations.    
- Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon, has a population of around 36,201. The First Nations already lived there several thousand years ago. The population of Whitehorse rose sharply after the discovery of gold in Klondike (gold rush) in 1896. Winter days there are very short, while summer days can be up to 19 hours long. Because Whitehorse is located in a valley, the temperature there is mild compared to other places at the same latitude. In winter, however, temperatures can drop to -40 degrees.    
- Many attractions are already closed for the season at the beginning of October, so the summer season is very short.    
- The Yukon River, after which Yukon was named, runs through the northwest of America. It is the fifth largest river in North America.
