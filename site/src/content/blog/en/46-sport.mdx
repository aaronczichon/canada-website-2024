Two days after we returned from our fantastic Yukon and Alaska vacation, Pia & Tobi arrived.   
They had been looking forward to their Canadian vacation and their visit to us for a long time.

Calgary itself is giving us a long fall by Canadian standards. As a result, temperatures are currently fluctuating between -2 degrees and 16 degrees. Perfect weather for some sport!      
We went to a Calgary Flames game with Pia and Tobi. The Flames are playing in the NHL, the highest ice hockey league in the world.   
So far we had only been to games in Halifax. It was an even greater experience to see such a big professional team playing.   
The stadium is also much bigger and the atmosphere really gets you going!   
The Flames and the Pittsburgh Penguins even showed us the full program including overtime and shoot-out. Fortunately, Calgary also won 4:3.

The following Saturday, last week, we had signed up for the “Dash of Doom”. This is a running series organized by the “Run Calgary” club using the Halloween theme.   
Both Lea and I had signed up for the 5km run. Our goal was actually to test our performance a bit after having been running regularly since March.   
Neither of us expected the wonderful conditions (14 degrees, sunny and no wind) to have such a good effect on our runs.   
Lea ran a personal best time of 25:16 minutes. I also ran my best time so far with 20:57 minutes.    
Running at least once a week (since March) has brought some improvements.  

We are now using the long Halloween weekend to drive to Edmonton from Friday to Sunday and see the city. On Monday, Pia and Tobi will join us for another 3 nights before they fly back home.   
But more about that in the next blog post.
