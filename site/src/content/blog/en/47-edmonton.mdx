  We're from Germany and we want to learn as much as we can about the history and the current situation of the indigenous people in Canada. As we're not native English speakers we may made mistakes or didn't understood everything correctly. We apologize for that.   
  If you feel offended or have any suggestions and improvements for this text, please let us know. We are happy to learn and improve.

Over the long weekend, we drove to Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. It is located about 300km north of Calgary. On Friday morning, after a stop for breakfast at Tim Hortens, we arrived in Edmonton around noon. As the weather was cold and rainy, we decided to go to the West Edmonton Mall. It is the largest shopping mall in North America and contains a swimming pool, movie theater, mini golf course, go-kart track, lake, ice skating rink, car dealership, children's amusement park and all kinds of stores. It was impressive how huge the mall is.

We then drove to the city centre to have a look around. One thing that always strikes us is that most Canadian cities don't really have a pedestrianized city centre. We had a look at the town hall, the art gallery, the library and the ice hockey stadium from the outside. After dinner, in a cozy brewery, we made our way to the hotel, which was located just outside the city. 

The next day we decided to drive to the Elk Island National Park, which is about half an hour from Edmonton. The drive to the park took a little longer than expected. It started to snow in the morning and it was -2 degrees. The sleet made it very slippery. We discovered that our rental car only had all-weather tires. We researched that winter tires are only mandatory in two Canadian provinces (Québéc and British Columbia) and only between 15.12. and 15.03. This means that many Canadians drive with summer tires even in winter. Especially with rental car companies, you have to explicitly book winter tires. This is good to know for our future bookings.    
Once we arrived in the national park, we set off in search of bison. We didn't see any on our 12 km hiking trail. Only when we drove further through the park did we come across the large, beautiful animals right by the roadside.

On the drive back to Edmonton, we drove a few kilometers along large refineries, the not so great part of Canada. In Edmonton we paid 1.319CAD per liter for gas, which is about 0.87€.

Back in Edmonton, we made a stop at the old Government House. After dinner in a great English pub, we took a look at the city skyline during the night time. 
On Sunday we wanted to visit Fort Edmonton Park. In this park there is a kind of open-air museum, which is supposed to depict the history of Canada. Unfortunately, it was already closed for the winter season. We decided to take a walk along the North Saskatchewan River because the weather was very sunny and warm. 

Luckily for us, the Indigenous Museum was open. The visit to this museum was definitely worthwhile and once again we found it very impressive (although we have already been to several museums). We were able to learn a lot about their culture, history and the current situation from three people with indigenous roots. I would like to tell you more about this: 
We spoke to a woman who belongs to the Métis people. In Canada, there are First Nations, Métis and Inuit. People are classified as Métis if one parent is Indigenous and one parent is white, i.e. belongs to the “European settlers” of the 1800s and 1900s.     
The woman told us that if, for example, a woman is indigenous and marries a white man, she loses all indigenous rights and her indigenous status (i.e. First Nation status). If an Indigenous man marries a white woman, then the white woman gets all Indigenous rights. 
The Indigenous rights were defined in the Indian Act and the various areas of Canada were divided into so-called “Treaties”. With “indigenous” rights, for example, you get sections of land or you can do tax-free business. Many indigenous people live on reserves. We used to think that the reserves belonged to the indigenous people. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The reserves belong to Canada and if, for example, there are raw materials on the sections of land, then they belong to Canada and not to the indigenous people. Ultimately, therefore, no land belongs to the indigenous people, even though this was promised to them at the time of the agreements. It is also the case, for example, that if an indigenous person becomes a judge or doctor and obtains a higher academic degree, this person automatically loses their status.   
Another woman told us about her roots. Her mother belonged to the First Nations and her father was European. Her mother had lost her Indigenous status through marriage, although she herself had been in a residential school and had been severely traumatized as a result. Because her mother no longer had any status, the woman we spoke to had no status either. Her mother had fought for a long time to regain her indigenous status and had then regained it. The woman we spoke to now also has a certain status (she had to prove her indigenous ancestry through blood tests) and receives 4 dollars a year from the Canadian state (the equivalent of €2.68). She told us about another problem: the fact that she herself looks too white made it difficult for her to be integrated into her indigenous community. They thought she looked too white and perhaps wasn't indigenous at all. She felt that she did not belong either among the whites or among the indigenous people, which was very difficult for her and her identity.    
The woman wants to speak publicly about her story and fight for her community. For her, the "history" is still relevant. Trauma is passed on to the next generation genetically, but also through upbringing and behaviour (so-called transgenerational traumatization). In 2005, all survivors of the Residential Schools were invited to talk about their experiences. They were asked to testify about what had happened to them, fill out questionnaires and give the names of the priests who had done something to them. The woman's mother collapsed on site due to the high psychological stress and was unable to continue filling out these questionnaires. As a result, she did not receive any compensation.

The indigenous people ultimately lost everything, be it their language, family members or the basis of their livelihood, for example animals such as the buffalo. These animals were very important to them for making tools, toys, tippis and clothing and, of course, for food. When the white settlers arrived, all the buffalo were murdered, taking away the entire basis of the indigenous people's livelihood.

Indigenous people are still massively discriminated against and disadvantaged today. 

With many thoughts in our heads and enormous gratitude for the openness of the people in the museum, we made our way home to Calgary.
