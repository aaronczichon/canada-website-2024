We used the past weekend for another trip.   
This time, and probably for the last time this year, we went back to the Rocky Mountains to Lake Louise.   
The Lake Louise ski resort has started its early season program and a few slopes are already ready.

Friday afternoon after work, we picked up another rental car and set off.   
We stopped for dinner in Canmore and then arrived in the small village of the same name, Lake Louise, in the dark.   
Our accommodation was the Lake Louise Inn, where we also got a free upgrade to a suite.

On Friday morning, after breakfast at the [Trailhead Caf√©](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m6YFzz7pZS8rr35cA), we drove to the ski resort.   
Once we had rented our ski equipment and printed our tickets, the ski day could begin! We were super lucky with the weather. The sun came out around 10 am and we had the best conditions until the afternoon.   
After we got back to the lodge, we had dinner at the Timberwolf Restaurant.

On Sunday morning, we made a quick trip to Lake Louise.   
We already knew it from 2022, but covered in snow and with almost no tourists, it was almost an even more beautiful sight.   
Before heading back to Calgary, we stopped for a late breakfast in Banff and strolled through the small town.

Our time in Calgary is slowly coming to an end. We now have one last full weekend here before heading to Thunder Bay on November 30th.
