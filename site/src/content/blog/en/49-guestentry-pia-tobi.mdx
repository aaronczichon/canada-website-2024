  <summary>Additional hint by Aaron and Lea</summary>
  Temporal context: Pia and Tobi visited us from October 20 to November 7, 2024.
</details>

Our journey began on Saturday, November 19, 2024, when we took the train to Frankfurt. There, we planned to spend a night in a hotel and then continue our journey the next morning on a direct flight to Calgary. However, as is often the case, everything turned out differently than expected: our flight was canceled at short notice. After 24 hours of detours and changes in Vienna and Montreal, we finally arrived at Aaron and Lea's apartment in Calgary, exhausted but happy. There we were greeted with burritos and our first Canadian beer. After that, it was just “off to bed” - we were simply too tired for more.

The next morning, the world looked much friendlier again. After a hearty bagel breakfast, we set off to explore Calgary. First we went to the city's largest mall, where we immediately took advantage of the low prices in the Apple Store. Then we continued on to the city center, where Aaron and Lea showed us some of the city's most impressive skyscrapers. The day ended with burgers and beer in a cozy pub.

The second day was all about our first excursion. After a stop at Tim Hortons, we made our way to Dinosaur Provincial Park, around 250 km away. Despite a blanket of snow, we were able to hike some of the trails and had our first encounters with Canadian reindeer. Unfortunately, not everything was accessible due to the wintry weather, so we left after about two hours. On the way back, we visited Calgary's city center, where we treated ourselves to a portion of poutine before watching the Calgary Flames' NHL ice hockey game live in the stadium.

On Wednesday, the time had finally come: our actual road trip began. After leaving Calgary behind us, we soon caught sight of the first mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains. After around three hours' drive, we reached the famous Lake Louise, where we embarked on a very icy hiking trail. Here we were amazed for the first time at the choice of footwear made by some tourists who tackled the steep, icy mountain path in sandals. We then drove briefly to Banff, but the town was a little too touristy for us. After another snack at Tim Hortons, which had become our preferred place for coffee breaks and snacks, we continued on to our first accommodation near Canmore - a cozy wooden cabin in a small complex. The evening passed over pasta with tomato sauce and a few rounds of Yahtzee.

On Thursday, after breakfast at Tim Hortons, we continued our journey. On the way to the vicinity of Banff, we encountered a whole herd of reindeer in the middle of town. Our first destination was Johnston Canyon, where we were almost completely on our own as the tourist season was already over. On a three-kilometre hike through a narrow gorge, we were able to marvel at an impressive waterfall. We then drove on to Lake Minnewanka, where we went on another hike. Our hopes of spotting a bear or moose were not fulfilled, but we had a lot of fun listening out for any unusual noises. However, it was mostly just squirrels scolding us to show their dissatisfaction.

On Friday morning, we made our way to our next accommodation, near Mt. Robson. We made a few stops on the way there. First, we visited Emerald Lake in Yoho National Park and then drove along the legendary Icefield Parkway - an approximately 250-kilometer road that leads through a breathtaking mountain landscape. That was definitely a highlight of the trip for me (Tobi). At Peyton Lake, around 2000 meters above sea level, we made another stop and trudged a few kilometers up the mountain in bright sunshine and deep snow.   
Shortly before the end of the Icefield Parkway, near Jasper, the devastating consequences of last summer became visible: a whole 30-kilometre stretch of land full of burnt tree remains, and the town of Jasper had also suffered badly from the forest fires. After another hour's drive, we finally reached Valemont, a small village about 20 km from our next accommodation. Here we stocked up on essentials at the local supermarket and liquid store before setting off on the last leg of our journey. One particularly interesting observation on the 600-kilometre route was that we only passed through the towns of Banff, Lake Louise, Jasper and Valemont, none of which had more than 10,000 inhabitants.

Our new accommodation, where we spent a total of three nights, was the perfect starting point for our next explorations. On the first day, we went on a hike to Kinney Lake, which lies at the foot of Mt Robson - the highest mountain in Canada. We didn't meet anyone here either, which added to the tranquillity and seclusion. After the 10 km hike, we turned back as the weather continued to deteriorate. However, it was also a welcome opportunity to spend a few relaxing hours. The evening passed with a hearty pasta bake, a few rounds of Kniffel and Skippo before we fell tiredly into bed.

The rain didn't stop the next day either, so we decided to take the car back to the Icefield Parkway to visit the Athabasca Glacier - which we had only seen in passing last time. After driving around 250 km, we reached our destination, but the weather threw a spanner in the works. Visibility was just 10 meters and there was nothing to see of the glacier. Disappointed, but also a little amused, we made our way back after half an hour. Fortunately, gas is cheap in Canada, so the drive wasn't too bad.

The next morning, October 28, we continued on to our most beautiful accommodation, which we found near Bridge Lake. On the 500 km drive, we made a stop at Wells Gray Park near Clearwater, where we first visited the impressive Helmcken Waterfall - it was gigantic compared to the waterfalls in Johnston Canyon. We then decided to visit Clearwater Lake, 25 km away. The way there led along a dirt road with huge potholes and without mobile phone reception, it was not without risk. But our rental car held up well and we made it safely back to civilization. Our accommodation was a remote ranch with only four log cabins for guests. Luckily for us, we were the only guests and the main house was only looked after by one of the ranch owners' employees.   
After a short snowstorm, we ended the evening in the hot tub on the veranda of our cabin. It was incredibly quiet here, a tranquillity that is hard to find in Germany. The starry sky was so much brighter and clearer that it became one of Pia's highlights of the trip.

The next morning, we explored the grounds of our accommodation. It offered enough space for a long walk without us having to leave it. In the afternoon, we set off on foot to the nearby Montana Lake, where we enjoyed the day on a jetty with a cold beer. The evening naturally ended in the hot tub again, while we took in the magnificent view and the absolute silence.

On October 30, we continued our journey to Whistler. We drove through some of the most beautiful landscapes on the way, but when we arrived in Whistler, the weather was unfortunately rainy and the view of the mountains was obscured by clouds. We therefore only strolled through the town center a little and then stopped for a leisurely dinner.

The next day, we drove on to North Vancouver. On the way there, we made short stops in the coastal towns of Squamish and Horseshoe Bay. Once we arrived in North Vancouver, we walked to the harbor, where an impressive view of downtown Vancouver awaited us. After a short break in a bar, we met up with Wolle and Heidi, who also happened to be in Vancouver. We went out for dinner together and ended the evening with a cheerful get-together.

On Friday, we headed to Vancouver in a storm and rain. Getting around was a little more difficult, as there is no subway in Vancouver and only bus connections. The first bus broke down, so we sat hungover in the bus shelter in the rain and cold for 30 minutes before we finally made it to downtown Vancouver. We strolled through the city and visited a viewing platform before getting back on the bus to the hotel.

On November 2, we drove on to our last accommodation in Kamloops. As the journey took around five hours, we didn't do anything else that day. The evening was spent relaxing with pasta with tomato sauce and a well-earned break in the sauna.

The next morning began with a typical Canadian breakfast: bagels and bacon, before we set off on two hikes around Kamloops Lake. Here we were able to admire completely new vegetation, while the weather played along. After about 12 km of hiking and a short stop in Kamloops - where we bought the most expensive cheese roll of our lives for almost €10 - we made our way back to our accommodation.

The following day, we set off on our longest stage back to Calgary. We experienced a huge snowstorm on the 800 km route through the Rocky Mountains, but we survived this adventure unscathed. In the evening we arrived back at Aaron and Lea's home in Calgary.   
We spent the last three days relaxing with them, enjoying leisurely rounds of Skyjo and a few restaurant visits as well as walks through the city. On November 8, without any further incidents, we finally boarded our flight home.

We are incredibly happy to have taken this trip - which was also our honeymoon. It offered us countless wonderful moments and we are grateful to have met you both again in Canada after such a long time. Thank you again for a wonderful time, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.
