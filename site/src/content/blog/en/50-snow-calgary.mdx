After we came back from the ski weekend the weekend before last, it was still a cozy 7-8 degrees in Calgary.   
Monday, however, surprised us with heavy snowfall in Calgary. Since then it has been snowing more or less every day.   
It's wonderful that now that our time in Calgary is coming to an end this week, we can still experience the start of winter here.   
Of course, we have taken advantage of this more than once for afternoon walks in the snow.

To get into the winter mood even more, we went to the Olympic Oval last Wednesday. This is the official training hall for speed skaters in Canada. There are also public skating times there. Standing on the ice for the first time this year was still a bit difficult. That's why we went again on Sunday. With a bit of practice, we'll be really good by the time we get back. At least that's the goal.   

Since our next place of residence, Thunder Bay, doesn't have an NHL team, we went to one last Calgary Flames game (against the New York Rangers) on Thursday. The Flames won 4:3.

Some time ago we discovered a Harry Potter bar, which was supposed to be in Calgary.    
On Friday evening we drove to the Inglewood district and visited this bar. Although the cocktails there are very expensive, we had a lot of fun.   
There are TVs hanging on the walls and different fantasy movies are playing all the time. The menu is in the style of a Harry Potter parchment and the drinks are also called the same as in the books or films.   
The walls are decorated with pictures, lettering and much more in the style of a bar in Diagon Alley.   
Definitely worth a visit.

On Saturday, we visited a small “Christmas market” in the same part of town.   
However, this had little in common with the concept of a “Christmas market” as we know it here. Nevertheless, we had a nice afternoon and ended our last weekend in Calgary on Sunday with a walk in Nose Hill Park and a round of ice skating.
