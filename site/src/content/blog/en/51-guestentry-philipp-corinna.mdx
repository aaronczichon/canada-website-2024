## Welcome to Alberta

Landing in Calgary surprises us with 30 degrees and bright sunshine - not exactly the Canada you imagine in the fall. It's Corinna's first long-haul flight, but the anticipation outweighs the fear of flying and jet lag. In Calgary, we meet Aaron and Lea, who will accompany us for the next few days.

The very first excursion - along endless straight roads - shows us the contrasts of the country: In Dinosaur Provincial Park, the endless prairie suddenly transforms into a landscape of huge red rocks and deep gorges. Alberta's badlands tell a 75-million-year-old story. Narrow paths lead through the surreal landscape between petrified tree trunks and layers of fossilized rock. The sun is blazing as we explore the various layers of rock where Tyrannosaurus Rex and Albertosaurus once left their tracks.

## A special moment in the Rocky Mountains

After three days in Calgary, we set off together for the Rocky Mountains. With every kilometer of the drive to Canmore, the mountains rise up into the sky in front of us. The small town lies in the shadow of the Three Sisters - three striking peaks that rise above the valley like a natural cathedral. The first peak, “Big Sister”, rises 2,936 meters into the air, followed by “Middle Sister” and “Little Sister”. Together they form one of the most characteristic mountain formations in the region.

The next morning, we pack our rucksacks for a special hike. The trail leads us through dense coniferous forest, past crystal-clear mountain streams. The view over the endless chain of the Rocky Mountains opens up with every meter of ascent. After a two-hour ascent, we reach a point where the view is breathtaking: snow-capped peaks stretching to the horizon, interspersed with green valleys and the shimmering silver river. Here, with this overwhelming backdrop, I ask Corinna if she would like to be my wife. She says yes with all her heart.

## The beauty of Canada's national parks

After this special moment, we say goodbye to Aaron and Lea, who have made this day unforgettable for us. We part ways and set off for the Johnston Canyons. Millennia of erosion have created an accessible canyon here. Thundering waterfalls plunge into the depths, while narrow footbridges lead us deeper and deeper into the gorge. The inkpots at the end of the trail surprise us with their mineral-rich water, which shimmers in various shades of blue and green.

In Lake Louise, we experience a dramatic change in the weather. Lake Moraine, one of the most photographed lakes in Canada, presents us with a wintery atmosphere. Snowfall transforms the landscape into a white wonderland - a magical contrast to the summery temperatures of the previous days.

Route 93 to Jasper, also known as the Icefields Parkway, becomes a journey of discovery through a landscape marked by fire, but no less impressive. Jasper welcomes us with special warmth and becomes our base camp for four days. Our hikes take us to hidden lakes whose water is so clear that you can see every stone at the bottom. At Jasper Lake we discover a natural phenomenon: when the water level is low, extensive sand dunes appear - a surprising sight in the middle of the mountain landscape.

## The way to the Pacific coast

In Wells Gray Provincial Park near Clearwater, waterfalls thunder down from the height of the Ulm Minster - a force of nature that leaves us in awe. The drive through British Columbia shows the incredible diversity of the landscape: from alpine zones to desert areas near Kamloops and dense coastal forests. The ferry ride to Vancouver Island is an unexpected highlight - with a first-class dinner at sunset on the Pacific, while the coastline slowly disappears in the evening light.

## Vancouver Island: Where the rainforest meets the Pacific Ocean
					
We originally wanted to spend more time in Vancouver, but then extended our stay on Vancouver Island during the trip.

We spend the night in Port Alberni and drive along Route 4 towards Tofino the next day. This is where the rainforest meets the Pacific: centuries-old, gigantic trees and magnificent ferns characterize the coastal forest, while their roots wind their way through thick layers of moss, creating an ecosystem full of life. . The constant drizzle is part of everyday life here and gives the forest its special atmosphere. We are amazed by the colors, the nature and the overall atmosphere.

Over the next few days, we travel south on the island. In Victoria, we experience another highlight of our trip: Whale watching, where over 15 whales make an appearance. The majestic spectacle of the surfacing humpback whales and their powerful flukes leave even our experienced captain in awe.
					
## Vancouver
					
Vancouver is the short but intense end to our trip. We spend the night downtown between modern high-rise buildings and explore the city center. On the way to the airport, we have one last view of the mountain ranges on the horizon. We will definitely be back.
					
## A country full of surprises
					
Canada gave us more than we hoped for: breathtaking nature experiences, warm encounters and a very special moment in the mountains. The variety of landscapes, from the Alberta prairies to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific rainforest, made a deep impression on us. We return with a head full of memories, a ring on our finger and the certainty that we will remember these three weeks forever.

## Practical tips for Canadian travelers
					
- The best experiences are often found off the beaten track
- Plan for weather extremes: from midsummer to snowfall, anything is possible
- Flexible travel planning pays off: our spontaneous change of plans in favor of Vancouver Island was spot on 
- Intensive research is worthwhile for accommodation - the price alone says little about the quality
- Food in supermarkets is surprisingly expensive, but restaurants are often inexpensive
- Local recommendations are worth their weight in gold - especially for restaurants and hiking routes
- The low season in fall offers pleasant temperatures and fewer tourists
