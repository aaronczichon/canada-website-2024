We arrived in Thunder Bay, Ontario last weekend (November 30th).

We enjoyed our last week in Calgary as much as we could. We knew it would be hard to leave Calgary. After Halifax, Calgary is our 2nd favorite city in Canada.    
We went out twice for eating (once in our “favorite pub”, the Trolley 5 Pub) and attended one last great event: the Calgary Zoo Lights.

The Calgary Zoo Lights take place annually at the zoo after normal opening hours.    
The trees, houses and plants are festively decorated in the Canadian style. The whole thing is then themed and you can walk through the light displays with hot chocolate or a cold drink.    
If you want, you can also sit by one of the many open fires and warm up or do a few laps on the skating rink.    
Luckily, we discovered this by chance and bought tickets on the spur of the moment. It was definitely worth it.

On Saturday, it was time to say goodbye to Calgary and make our way to the airport.    
We went to Thunder Bay with a stopover in Toronto. Our last, longer stay and the place where we will spend Christmas and New Year.   

We arrived in Thunder Bay late in the evening with an hour's delay (thanks Air Canada, once again....).   
As we couldn't move into our new accommodation until December 1st, we spent the first night in a hotel at the airport and then arrived relaxed in our little house on Sunday morning.

As the days are relatively short here too and we work most of the time during the week, we haven't been able to do that much yet.   
However, the exceptions were the Holiday Train (on Monday evening) and Saturday.   
We went downtown to explore the city a bit. Unfortunately, the weather was really bad. It had snowed the days before and then the temperatures unfortunately climbed above 0 degrees. As a result, it was slippery and the snow turned into rain.   
Nevertheless, we found a small café and went to the Parade of Lights in the evening after dinner.

We can't wait to see what else Thunder Bay has in store for us over the next few weeks!
