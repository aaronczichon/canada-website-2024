We have settled in really well in Thunder Bay over the last few weeks.    
The first "rinks" (ice skating rinks) have also been open since the beginning of the month. We quickly found our favorite spot. The Arthur's Landing Rink at the harbor. It is easily accessible by bus, is maintained daily and even has changing rooms.   
Overall, you can really tell in the winter months that Canadians are winter sports enthusiasts. Especially ice skating and field hockey. In Thunder Bay alone, there are 38 (!) public skating rinks. These include places like the one at the harbor, field hockey fields but also icing trails (walking paths in parks that are converted into ice skating rinks in winter).

You can get into the Christmas spirit here simply because there are so many houses with all kinds of fairy lights and decorations. We've put together a small selection for you so that you can take part.

We have been on vacation since December 20th (up to and including January 8th) and have rented a car again during this time.   
We will now use it intensively to explore the area around Thunder Bay.   
We started on the Sunday before the Christmas holidays. We drove to the nearby ski resort (~20min) and had our 2nd day of skiing in Canada.

Even though we missed the family a bit over the Christmas holidays, we still had a wonderful Christmas time.    
Our days consisted of ice skating and good food.   
We tried our hand at a classic Canadian (British) dish: Beef Wellington. This is a fillet of beef wrapped in a mushroom mixture, Parma ham and puff pastry. And what can I say: it turned out brilliantly!   
On Boxing Day, the second day of Christmas, we treated ourselves to beef roulades (so that we also had a German Christmas dish).

Perhaps it should be noted that in Canada only Christmas Day is really "Christmas". December 24th is still Christmas Eve and people still have to work (similar to us, however, most stores are only open until midday).    
The 2nd Christmas Day is called "Boxing Day" here. It is already a normal working day for many people and gets its name from the fact that it is a kind of shopping event. Many things are offered at very low prices in the shopping malls and stores. Virtually everything that was not sold at Christmas.   
Especially in the past, before the online shopping era, queues would form just before the stores opened to "fight their way through" and get the best deals.

The next few days before and after the New Year we will be visiting the surrounding Provincial and National Parks. We will of course keep you up to date.   
Until then, we hope you had a great Christmas and are off to a good start in the New Year!
