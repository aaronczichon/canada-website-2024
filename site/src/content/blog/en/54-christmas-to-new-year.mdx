We used the time "between the years" to continue exploring the area around and in Thunder Bay.   

## Quetico Provincial Park
For example, we drove to Quetico Provincial Park on December 27th. This park is located about 2 hours west of Thunder Bay in the direction of Manitoba.   

Just getting there shows us again what a big country we are in. Even after more than 9 months, we are still overwhelmed every time we drive 150km on the highway and see nothing but countryside. Signs saying “Check fuel level, no service next 200km” are still funny the 7th or 8th time and even a spontaneous time zone change still comes as a surprise.

As most parks are closed or inaccessible in winter, we had checked in advance whether the park had anything to offer.   
We were lucky, the park's campsite is prepared for cross-country skiing in winter and there are designated snowshoe trails. So we went there in the hope that we would be able to hire snowshoes on site.   
Unfortunately, both the visitor center and some of the trails were closed.    
However, there were two pairs of snowshoes available for hire at the parking lot for the cross-country ski trail and the snowshoe trail.   
After equipping ourselves with these, we walked the Teaching Trail (yes, it really is called that) along French Lake.

## Going to the cinema in Canada

Unfortunately, it rained the whole day on 28.12. So we only went for a short walk at lunchtime and enjoyed the view of Thunder Bay from Hillcrest Park.   
In the evening we went to the movies. As in Germany, there are hardly any independent movie theaters left in Canada. In Thunder Bay, for example, there is only one large movie theater belonging to the Cineplex chain.    
The movie theater is quite large with 12 screens. In the middle of the entrance hall there are the usual cinema snacks and at the entrance, unlike in Germany, there are only vending machines where you can choose your movie, time and seat and pay by card.    
We went to see "A complete unknown". It's about the story of Bob Dylan. It was entertaining and the movie is definitely a recommendation.

## Ouimet Canyon

On 29.12. we drove east. We had already been to the Sleeping Giant Provincial Park there a few days ago. This time, however, our destination was Ouimet Canyon.    
Unfortunately, the longest suspension bridge in Canada was closed out of season.   
We therefore wanted to drive to the canyon's parking lot and from there at least to the viewing platforms.   
Unfortunately, the road was not cleared and we had to walk the 3.7 km to the parking lot. Fortunately, from there it was only 400-500m to the platform.    
But the walk was worth it. The view was wonderful!

We hope you enjoyed reading our blog this year. It was and is always great for us to write down the events once again and publish them here.   
We hope you'll continue to follow us for the next two months of our trip (January and February) and we wish you a great start to the new year!
