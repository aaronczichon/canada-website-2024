As you already know, we spent 2.5 weeks on vacation in Yukon and Alaska in October.   
We already showed you a few pictures and told you about our experiences in our blog post.   
We also made some videos there and as we were very impressed, especially me, I edited the video material into a video. It's our longest travel video to date.   
I hope it gives you a little impression of this beautiful area. However, it can only be partially conveyed in a video.
