Why did we go to Canada from March to March 1 year? That's something we've been asked a lot over the years.    
The reason is relatively simple: We wanted to take in all the ‚Äúbig‚Äù events of a year in Canada. This includes Christmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. If we had gone from January to December, the stress at the end of the year would have meant that we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the turn of the year. It was therefore best for us to arrive and depart in March, as there is relatively little going on at this time of year.

On New Year's Eve, we went for a 3-course meal at the [Bight Restaurant & Bar](https://www.bightrestaurant.ca/).   
Afterwards we went back to our house. Shortly before midnight we drove to Hillcrest Park to watch the fireworks.   
However, we realized that the Canadians don't or hardly ever have fireworks in private. As a result, the sky over Thunder Bay remained largely dark.   
In larger cities such as Toronto, Montr√©al, Calgary or Vancouver, there are of course fireworks organized by the city. However, fireworks are much more expensive in Canada than here. Therefore, hardly anything is set off by private individuals. In addition, the temperatures are so low (-20 degrees is rather ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at this time of year) that people are simply too cold for fireworks.   
It was also interesting to experience the turn of the year without fireworks.

On New Year's Day, we went back to the Loch Lomond ski resort in the morning. There was a ‚Äúpay what you want‚Äù promotion for the lift ticket and $20 for hiring equipment.   
Although there is still some snow, it is mainly the same snow from the beginning of December. The slopes were and still are just ice and unfortunately we didn't have much fun.

On January 2, we drove to Boulevard Lake and went for a walk around the reservoir.   
Here, too, the cold temperatures gave us a bit of a hard time, but we bravely completed the 5 km or so.   
On January 3, we drove to Sleeping Giant Provincial Park again. There, the park rangers at the campsite had prepared the paths so that a skating rink had been created.   
I think it's wonderful that there are so many different winter sports options in Canada. You can really tell that Canadians love winter. From skiing, ice skating and cross-country skiing to snowmobiling, dog sledding and curling, there is simply everything. 

In the last few days, we got back into the swing of things. We actually wanted to go dog sledding, snowmobiling and cross-country skiing. However, there is currently a lack of fresh snow. That's why we started work again on 7 January and usually spend our afternoons skating at our favorite spot in the harbour.

**Canada üá®üá¶ Facts ‚úîÔ∏è**  
Today: Thunder Bay Edition   

Over the past few days, Lea has collected a few facts about Thunder Bay, Ontario and the surrounding area and would like to share them with you.

- Ontario is the most populous province and the second largest province in Canada in terms of area after Qu√©bec. Ontario is home to the largest number of Indigenous people (approximately 374,395 inhabitants). 133 First Nation communities are located in Ontario. One in four First Nation communities is a so-called ‚Äúremote‚Äù community, which means that they can only be reached by plane in summer and via ice roads in winter.    
- Here in Ontario, too, most of the largest cities are located in the south of the province (along the border with the USA). The further north you go, the more sparsely populated the province becomes and there are hardly any roads.    
- There are over 330 parks in Ontario (including six national parks), of which we visited three provincial parks near Thunder Bay. Many parks with a campground are used for cross-country skiing or snowshoeing in the winter.    
- The city of Thunder Bay is located on Lake Superior in northwestern Ontario (population approximately 108,000) and is about 70 km north of the American border. Thunder Bay is the metropolitan region with the highest proportion of Indigenous people in Canada (12.7 percent of the population). Approximately 10,000 people with Italian roots live in Thunder Bay. There is also an Italian cultural center, restaurants and a butcher.    
- Indigenous people, including the Shield Archaic Peoples, lived here 10,000 years ago. Thunder Bay was founded on the traditional territory of the Anishinabek indigenous group, which includes the Ojibwa of Fort William First Nation. The people at that time made and traded copper tools. In the late 17th century, European settler arrived and settled on the territory for trading purposes. In 1970, several districts (e.g. Fort William and Port Arthur) were merged and the name Thunder Bay was created.    
- Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world in terms of area and the third largest in terms of volume. In the Ojibwe language, the lake is called ‚Äúgichi-gami‚Äù and means ‚ÄúGreat Sea‚Äù. The border between Canada and the USA runs through the lake. The shore length of the lake is 4,385 km.
