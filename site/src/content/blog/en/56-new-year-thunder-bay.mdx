Why did we go to Canada from March to March 1 year? That's something we've been asked a lot over the years.    
The reason is relatively simple: We wanted to take in all the “big” events of a year in Canada. This includes Christmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. If we had gone from January to December, the stress at the end of the year would have meant that we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the turn of the year. It was therefore best for us to arrive and depart in March, as there is relatively little going on at this time of year.

On New Year's Eve, we went for a 3-course meal at the [Bight Restaurant & Bar](https://www.bightrestaurant.ca/).   
Afterwards we went back to our house. Shortly before midnight we drove to Hillcrest Park to watch the fireworks.   
However, we realized that the Canadians don't or hardly ever have fireworks in private. As a result, the sky over Thunder Bay remained largely dark.   
In larger cities such as Toronto, Montréal, Calgary or Vancouver, there are of course fireworks organized by the city. However, fireworks are much more expensive in Canada than here. Therefore, hardly anything is set off by private individuals. In addition, the temperatures are so low (-20 degrees is rather “normal” at this time of year) that people are simply too cold for fireworks.   
It was also interesting to experience the turn of the year without fireworks.

On New Year's Day, we went back to the Loch Lomond ski resort in the morning. There was a “pay what you want” promotion for the lift ticket and $20 for hiring equipment.   
Although there is still some snow, it is mainly the same snow from the beginning of December. The slopes were and still are just ice and unfortunately we didn't have much fun.

On January 2, we drove to Boulevard Lake and went for a walk around the reservoir.   
Here, too, the cold temperatures gave us a bit of a hard time, but we bravely completed the 5 km or so.   
On January 3, we drove to Sleeping Giant Provincial Park again. There, the park rangers at the campsite had prepared the paths so that a skating rink had been created.   
I think it's wonderful that there are so many different winter sports options in Canada. You can really tell that Canadians love winter. From skiing, ice skating and cross-country skiing to snowmobiling, dog sledding and curling, there is simply everything. 

In the last few days, we got back into the swing of things. We actually wanted to go dog sledding, snowmobiling and cross-country skiing. However, there is currently a lack of fresh snow. That's why we started work again on 7 January and usually spend our afternoons skating at our favorite spot in the harbour.
