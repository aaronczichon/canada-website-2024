Fortunately, neither of us had to go to the doctor in an emergency during our trip to Canada and neither of us was ill. 

However, I did have to go to the doctor because my thyroid medication had run out. The background: I have been taking this medication for a very long time and had already asked my GP before our trip whether I could be prescribed the medication for a year. However, for billing and insurance reasons, she was unable to prescribe it for a year. In June, during our visit to Germany, I was able to get a prescription and my mom also brought me a pack during her visit to Montréal. However, by the end of 2024, all the tablets were used up. Sending the tablets would not have worked, as medication cannot be imported by post.    
So we did some research and went to a walk-in clinic. Once there, we first had to pay a bill of 50 C$ (approx. 33.00€) to be allowed to speak to the doctor. I was issued an invoice for this. As I have often experienced in Canada, my surname is usually spelt incorrectly because the letters “ä” and “ß” do not exist in the English language. This often results in surnames like “Gr”, “Barbara (my middle name), 'Grab' or 'Gras'. This time, “Grab” was also on the bill. We decided to ask after the doctor's appointment if he could change the name to “Graess” (for submission to the insurance company). However, the receptionist had already googled it because he didn't know the letters. He then changed it himself and came to me with the invoice and the changed name. We have had experiences like this time and time again. Friendly and interested people.    
Then we were called to the doctor. I told the doctor that I had run out of tablets on our trip and needed new ones. He nodded and asked us which places we had visited in Canada. Then he briefly asked if 100 tablets were enough (I've never been prescribed that many at once in Germany). After about a minute and a half, we were out of the doctor's office, got the prescription and were able to leave.    
I have to be honest and say that I had imagined all sorts of things. I thought that they wouldn't believe me, that I had an underactive thyroid, that I would have to have blood tests again, etc. None of that turned out to be the case.

Then we went to the pharmacy and she told us that we would have to wait half an hour. There were chairs and a waiting area. And then after half an hour I received a small box with my name and the name of the medicine on it. I didn't know that each medicine is filled individually. 

All in all, it was a very positive experience. The only problem now is that my international health insurance refuses to cover the medical and medication costs because it is an ongoing treatment and not an acute treatment. However, we are currently trying to solve this problem.
