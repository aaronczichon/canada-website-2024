In the last post about our current events, we told you that we were still lacking fresh snow for the sled dogs and snowmobiling.   
The good news is that we did get some fresh snow (and not a little). The bad news, however, is that there is still not enough for the snowmobile and we had a few extremely cold days, which meant that the dog sledding didn't work out either.   

A polar storm has swept across North America in the last few days, reaching as far as Florida and even causing snow there. This only happens there every few decades. However, such extreme weather events are also likely to become more frequent due to climate change. The forest fires in California currently stand in stark contrast to this, which have hit Los Angeles particularly hard.

For northwestern Ontario and Thunder Bay, the polar wind meant one thing above all: extreme cold.    
I experienced my lowest temperatures so far in February 2018 in Montr√©al. It was -18 degrees there, which I found very cold.    
Then we had similar temperatures in November with the first snow in Calgary. However, this was nothing compared to the temperatures we experienced over the last few days. The highest temperatures during the day were -32 and -30 degrees. I had never experienced such cold before.    
No wonder you hardly saw any people on the street. We also spent most of our time indoors.   
Environment Canada explicitly warned against extreme cold and recommended not to stay outside for more than 20 minutes.

After the cold had thankfully eased towards the weekend, we attended another sporting event last Saturday.    
The Northern Ontario Provincial Curling Championship had been going on all week. This is the qualifying tournament for the championships in February (which will also take place in Thunder Bay).   
Neither of us had ever watched a curling game before, so we went to the Prince Arthur Curling Centre on Saturday with an open mind.   
The game we watched that afternoon lasted 2.5 hours and was really fun to watch.

We then used the following Sunday to finally skate again, even in the sunshine, at our favorite spot.   
Our last days in Thunder Bay are now in full swing and we are a little sad to be saying goodbye next Saturday.
