We continued our journey last weekend.   
After a long stay at the airport in Thunder Bay, we arrived in Toronto in the evening. We had to leave the apartment at 13:00 and our plane was delayed until shortly before 20:00.   
We stayed in a hotel in Toronto until Sunday. We then used the day to drive to Barrie. This is about 2 hours north of Toronto.   
By chance, we came across a winter festival on the bay in Barrie. There were ice and snow sculptures to marvel at and we were able to try maple taffy (the maple syrup is placed in snow and is edible a short time later as a kind of lolly). The bay was completely frozen over and the locals used it for snowmobiling or snowkiting (skiing on the snow and ice).    
There is also a snow tubing park in the local ski area. There you can ride down various snow slopes on a tire, similar to a water slide. That was great fun!  

In the evening, after a long drive, we arrived in London, Ontario.   
Yes, the city has the same name as the city of the same name in Great Britain. Many streets, parks and urban areas here also have the same name. In any case, you can't speak of great ingenuity here.   

Nach einer kleinen Erkundungstour durch die Innenstadt haben wir uns heute nat체rlich gleich auf die Suche nach einem Rink gemacht.   
In einem kleinen "Freizeitpark", dem Storybook Garden, sind wir dann f체ndig geworden. Hier gibt es eine lange Eislaufbahn durch den Park, welcher in weihnacht-winterlicher Tradition geschm체ckt ist. Da werden wir definitiv die n채chsten Tage noch 1-2 Mal hinfahren.
