Last Thursday evening we went for a walk through Harris Park in London, which is situated on the Thames River.    
We then took advantage of the sunshine on Friday afternoon to go for a walk on the two frozen lakes (Walkers and Westminster Ponds). The frozen ice there had even been prepared to create a rink for ice skating.

On Saturday, another major highlight was on the agenda. We drove to the town of Niagara Falls in Ontario to visit the famous waterfalls of the same name. It was impressive to see how the Niagara River was almost frozen over. This river connects Lake Erie with Lake Ontario. The waterfalls consist of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and the American and Bridal Veil Falls. The Niagara River also forms the border with the American sister city of the same name, Niagara Falls (in the US state of New York).    
We decided to take a look at the waterfalls from above. The view from the Skylon Tower was definitely worth it and is actually quite cheap during the winter season.    
On the way home, we visited the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. This small town is considered to be the most beautiful town in Canada. The facades of the houses in the town center are all in the same style. This is also where the Niagara River flows into Lake Ontario. You could also see Toronto in the distance, on the edge of the lake.

On the way home, it started to snow quite heavily. It was impressive how quickly the roads were full of snow, even though there was a lot of traffic. Fortunately, we had winter tires on our rental car (which is unfortunately not a matter of course and usually has to be booked separately). In Canada, winter tires are not mandatory except in the province of Québec and British Columbia. We also noticed this on Saturday, as there were a few cars in front of or next to us that skidded badly. At some point we had to guess which lane we were in. But we arrived safely back in London 1.5 hours late.

As it was our last full weekend in London, we wanted to use the time for another trip on Sunday. Aaron's first trip to Canada was to visit his great uncle in Sarnia in 2012. Unfortunately, we were unable to visit him and his wife for health reasons. Nevertheless, we wanted to visit the town, which is an hour away from London.    
Sarnia lies on the border with the American city of Port Huron. The Saint Clair River separates the two cities and countries. We took a walk through the Waterfront Park and to Canatara Beach on Lake Huron. The lake is the second largest lake in Canada after Lake Superior and the third largest freshwater lake in the world. After taking a look at the frozen harbor, we had a snack in a café and then made our way back home. It was a great weekend with lots of wonderful impressions! 

Aaron did make a video of the trip to Niagara Falls:
