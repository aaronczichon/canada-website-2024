Last Sunday we traveled from London to Toronto. Toronto is the last stop and from here we will be heading back to Germany on Thursday.   

It usually takes about 2 hours from London to Toronto. Depending on traffic conditions. The Greater Toronto Area is considered to have the worst traffic in North America. More and more cars are clogging up the roads and new roads and traffic routing have done little to nothing to improve the situation.    
However, our problem was not the traffic, but the snowstorm that swept across southern Ontario and Quebec on Saturday and Sunday.    
The roads had little to no clearance and you could rarely drive more than 60km/h. There were far fewer vehicles on the road than usual, but it still took us just over 4 hours to complete the route!    
Fortunately, we arrived at the hotel in Toronto without incident and then dropped the car off at the rental car station.   

Over the last few weeks and months, we've become big field hockey fans (yes, clich√© and all that). So of course we couldn't miss a visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame on Monday.   
We also took advantage of a small ice rink at the harbor, right next to our hotel.   

Today, Tuesday, we have to work again and then visit the Eaton Center in the late evening.   
For tomorrow, Wednesday - our last full day in Canada - we have already put together a bit of a program.    
On Thursday we leave at 19:45 (assuming Air Canada plays ball this time) and head back to Germany.
