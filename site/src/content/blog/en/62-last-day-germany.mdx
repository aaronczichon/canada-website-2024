We are (unfortunately) back in Germany. 

We used the last full day last Wednesday to go up the CN Tower in the morning. Even though it is excessively expensive (almost 50C$ per person), the view was definitely worth it. We had a great view over snow-covered Toronto and Lake Ontario. As it was only a little cloudy, you could even see as far as Hamilton.

In the afternoon, we went skating at the harbor one last time (which we probably won't be able to do in Germany anytime soon).   
We also ordered the first furniture for our new apartment in Germany.

Thursday was the day of our final departure. After a hearty breakfast, we checked out of the hotel. As our flight wasn't officially due to take off until 19:45, we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel and make the most of the time.   
As a final highlight, we took the ferry from Toronto to the Toronto Islands. To be more precise, to Ward's Island. On the way there, we had a long chat with a resident of the island and she told us a bit about the history. For example, it is not possible to sell your house on one of the islands (Ward's Island or Algonquin Island) on the open market. If you want to sell a house, the price is set by the city based on the age, size and size of the property. And you can only sell for this price. The buyer must also register their primary residence there. This is to prevent rich people from buying houses there as an investment or vacation resort for several million.   

We walked for a good hour on the two islands (which are connected by a bridge) and had a wonderful view of the Toronto skyline. 

After this little excursion, we made our way to the airport.    
Unfortunately, we had to spend more time there than we had planned. Boarding for our flight didn't start until 1.5 hours later than originally planned. 

We landed in Munich on Friday morning at 11:00 a.m. without any further incident.

It still feels a little surreal at the moment that we now have a permanent residence in Germany again.   

We hope you all had a great time and that we were able to take you with us on this journey.    
Keep checking back over the next few days. We have prepared a few more articles for you. Lea has also edited a 1.5 hour movie, which we will also publish here.   
We will integrate our previous Canada vacations together (2022 and 2023) into the website, add tips on restaurants and accommodation and add travel recommendations!    
We will continue to fill this blog and website with exciting content and hope that you will continue to join us.
