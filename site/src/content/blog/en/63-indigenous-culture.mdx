  We're from Germany and we want to learn as much as we can about the history and the current situation of the indigenous people in Canada. As we're not native English speakers we may made mistakes or didn't understood everything correctly. We apologize for that.   
  If you feel offended or have any suggestions and improvements for this text, please let us know. We are happy to learn and improve.

During my trip through Canada, I was always interested in the history and culture of the indigenous people.    
From the very beginning, I was impressed by the cultural diversity, openness and friendliness of Canadians. It doesn't matter where you come from - you are accepted and welcomed. We were often asked where we came from. And the answer was: “Oh great, welcome to Canada!”, regardless of whether they were people in the city or in the countryside. 
We got to know so many people from all over the world. We struck up a conversation with a man from Sudan at the streetcar ticket booth or with a cab driver who was taking us to the airport. Again and again, we learned things about the respective country and compared them with our own origins and with life in Canada (food prices, habits, behavior of the locals, weather, traffic). The Ukrainian cab driver was just as surprised as we were that you can simply turn left or make a U-turn on the highway in Canada.    
Of course, we also learned from the people about the difficulties of life in Canada. Inflation, the lack of affordable housing and the increasing migration of younger people to the cities are also causing problems here. 

The first time I learned about the history of Canada and Indigenous culture was through the week-long workshop at McGill University. This changed my perspective a lot. For me, Canada is still a country that is one of the best at integrating people from different backgrounds and cultures compared to other countries in the world. Nevertheless, I find it shocking how the people who were the first to live in the country were and still are treated. It also makes me sad and angry to see the consequences of colonization, not only in Canada, but also in many parts of Africa, for example.    
I would like to briefly summarize the history of Canada again, especially with regard to coexistence with the European settlers and the indigenous people. 

The settlers from Europe came to the land that is now called Canada and initially traded with the indigenous people. They lived together harmoniously and contentedly. In the ... century, the first treaties were concluded between the settlers and the indigenous people. These were agreed in order to postulate the rights of the indigenous people. Mediators from the British government and mediators from the indigenous people were involved in the talks in order to overcome the language barriers. The indigenous people promised the settlers that they would share the land if they had the right to hunt and fish for life. They also wanted to keep some areas for themselves, which the settlers were not allowed to use (today's reservations). However, misunderstandings repeatedly arose during the agreements and talks. One of the reasons for this was the language. In the language of the indigenous people (let's take one of the many languages as an example), the English word “surrender” does not exist. This means that the translation of this word was not possible, was sometimes translated differently and therefore no longer corresponded to the same understanding. Similarly, the indigenous people were sometimes promised things by the mediators (building schools, sharing agriculture), which the British government subsequently rejected. Thus began the increasing oppression of the indigenous people. This increased even more with the missionary work of the church and the establishment of resident schools.    
As we drove along the highway in Yukon, we kept seeing red clothes hanging from the trees. We then did some research: It is the REDress project, which deals with the issue of missing or murdered indigenous women across Canada. This project aims to draw attention to the gendered and racist nature of violent crimes against indigenous women.  

The museum visits and further online training on cultural safety and anti-racism made me think differently about many topics. I really appreciated being able to experience this knowledge, because only through it can I reflect and try to behave differently. I would like to share this knowledge with you.

I have found that being white is a privilege. At passport control at the airport, very little attention is paid to my passport (of a white woman).  My picture is barely looked at and I am let through immediately. The photo of the passenger behind me, who has a dark skin color (and that alone is ultimately racist, that you differentiate between white and black) is looked at several times, his name is checked and then he is let through.    
I don't have to prove that I have a certain degree, qualifications and a certain profession when I introduce myself somewhere. I am usually believed and taken seriously.    
I feel safe in the knowledge that if something happens to me and I call the police, I will be helped. 
Unfortunately, many people have the opposite experience. 

With this reflection, I would like to point out that we all have stereotypes and prejudices. That's not a bad thing at first, but we should be aware that we have them and then change them accordingly.
I caught myself doing this: I went to the Museum of Indigenous People and saw three female employees who looked white to me.  I had the thought: “Well, why are white people working here now if it's about indigenous culture? They can't really put themselves in the shoes of the indigenous people”. It turned out that all three employees were indigenous. They had one white parent and one indigenous parent. They belonged to the indigenous Métis group.    
Talking to people and asking questions when you don't understand something is incredibly important in order to overcome your own prejudices.    
With regard to my profession, I was also able to reflect on the fact that Western treatment methods in psychotherapy are not necessarily suitable and right for all people in the world. Each person should be considered individually and treated according to their specific needs. Cultural sensitivity is essential here. 

It is important not to categorize a person or their behaviour directly or to generalize about their culture or origin. Everyone should be considered individually.
