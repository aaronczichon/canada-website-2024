It's now been over 5 months since we returned from our year in Canada. I think back to that time every week and miss the impressions, the nature, and the relaxed way of life there. Unfortunately, everyday and leisure stress has returned here back in Germany to the same level as before the trip, and free days or evenings can be counted on one hand. It was quite different there. Despite a normal workday, it never felt like we had no time for other things. We often went outside into the nature after work, went ice skating or had time to go jogging and then have a drink in the city.

Started in the winter and continued after our return, Lea has edited a film about our time in Canada. This covers our entire journey and was previously reserved for visitors at our home. It also includes existing videos in chronological order that we had published here on the blog. Now everything is compiled into one big movie, which we would like to share with you today as a little retrospective.
