Every time we talk about our year in Canada, two things stand out to us.   
1. We loved every place we visited and would go back in a heartbeat. 
2. Of all the nature we experienced, Newfoundland and Yukon impressed us the most.    

Since there are still several places in Canada we want to see, it's time to get to "work" and visit those locations. This includes, among others, Yellowknife, Nunavut, Churchill (MB), and Inuvik.   
The latter is what we've set our sights on for 2026.

We are currently in the midst of planning our summer vacation in Yukon and the Northwest Territories.   
Currently, the plan is to fly from Germany to Calgary first and then 2-3 days later to Whitehorse, our actual starting point for the road trip.   
From Whitehorse, we will then head north on the Dempster Highway. 1600km via Dawson City to Inuvik and possibly even to Tuktoyaktuk.   
Whether we make it that far remains to be seen.

The flights to Calgary and Whitehorse (and back) are already booked. The mode of transport and accommodation options for the trip are still to be decided.   
Initially, we considered using a regular rental car for the journey and then staying in cabins and B&Bs.   
However, since the area is very sparsely populated and there are few accommodations, it will be challenging to find suitable and affordable lodging.   
We are now comparing offers for camping vehicles.

All in all, we are very much looking forward to sharing this adventure with you in the summer.
